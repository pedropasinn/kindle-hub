    Therefore I prayed, and prudence was given me; I pleaded and the spirit of
    Wisdom came to me. I preferred her to scepter and throne, And deemed riches
    nothing in comparison with her, nor did I liken any priceless gem to her;
    Because all gold, in view of her, is a bit of sand, and before her, silver
    is to be accounted mire. Beyond health and beauty I loved her, And I chose
    to have her rather than the light, because her radiance never ceases.

    Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice, and proclaimed to
    them, “You who are Jews, indeed all of you staying in Jerusalem. Let this be
    known to you, and listen to my words.
  </p>
  <p>
    You who are Israelites, hear these words. Jesus the Nazorean was a man
    commended to you by God with mighty deeds, wonders, and signs, which God
    worked through him in your midst, as you yourselves know. This man,
    delivered up by the set plan and foreknowledge of God, you killed, using
    lawless men to crucify him. But God raised him up, releasing him from the
    throes of death, because it was impossible for him to be held by it.
  </p>
  <p>
    God raised this Jesus; of this we are all witnesses. Exalted at the right
    hand of God,* he received the promise of the holy Spirit from the Father and
    poured it forth, as you (both) see and hear. For David did not go up into
    heaven, but he himself said: ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right
    hand until I make your enemies your footstool.”' Therefore let the whole
    house of Israel know for certain that God has made him both Lord and
    Messiah, this Jesus whom you crucified.”

    Paul, having arrived at Antioch in Pisidia, began to speak in the synagogue:
    'My brothers, sons of Abraham's race, and all you who fear God, this message
    of salvation is meant for you. What the people of Jerusalem and their rulers
    did, though they did not realise it, was in fact to fulfill the prophecies
    read on every sabbath. Though they found nothing to justify his death, they
    condemned him and asked Pilate to have him executed. When they had carried
    out everything that scripture foretells about him they took him down from
    the tree and buried him in a tomb. But God raised him from the dead, and for
    many days he appeared to those who had accompanied him from Galilee to
    Jerusalem: and it is these same companions of his who are now his witnesses
    before our people. 'We have come here to tell you the Good News. It was to
    our ancestors that God made the promise but it is to us, their children,

    The language of the cross may be illogical to those who are not on the way
    to salvation, but those of us who are on the way see it as God's power to
    save. As scripture says: I shall destroy the wisdom of the wise and bring to
    nothing all the learning of the learned. Where are the philosophers now?
    Where are the scribes? Where are any of our thinkers today? Do you see now
    how God has shown up the foolishness of human wisdom? If it was God's wisdom
    that human wisdom should not know God, it was because God wanted to save
    those who have faith through the foolishness of the message that we preach.
    And so, while the Jews demand miracles and the Greeks look for wisdom, here
    are we preaching a crucified Christ; to the Jews an obstacle that they
    cannot get over, to the pagans madness, but to those who have been called,
    whether they are Jews or Greeks, a Christ who is the power and the wisdom of
    God. For God's foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God's weakness is
    stronger than human strength.

    As for me, brothers, when I came to you, it was not with any show of oratory
    or philosophy, but simply to tell you what God had guaranteed. During my
    stay with you, the only knowledge I claimed to have was about Jesus, and
    only about him as the crucified Christ. Far from relying on any power of my
    own, I came among you in great 'fear and trembling' and in my speeches and
    the sermons that I gave, there were none of the arguments that belong to
    philosophy; only a demonstration of the power of the Spirit. And I did this
    so that your faith should not depend on human philosophy but on the power of
    God. But still we have a wisdom to offer those who have reached maturity:
    not a philosophy of our age, it is true, still less of the masters of our
    age, which are coming to their end. The hidden wisdom of God which we teach
    in our mysteries is the wisdom that God predestined to be for our glory
    before the ages began. lt is a wisdom that none of the masters of this age
    have ever known, or they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory; we
    teach what scripture calls: the things that no eye has seen and no ear has
    heard, things beyond the mind of man, all that God has prepared for those
    who love him. These are the very things that God has revealed to us through
    the Spirit.

    The Spirit reaches the depths of everything, even the depths of God.
    &nbsp;After all, the depths of a man can only be known by his own spirit,

    known by the Spirit of God. &nbsp;Now instead of the spirit of the world, we
    have received the Spirit that comes from God, to teach us to understand the
    gifts that he has given us. &nbsp;Therefore we teach, not in the way in
    which philosophy is taught, but in the way that the Spirit teaches us: we
    teach spiritual things spiritually. &nbsp;An unspiritual person is one who
    does not accept anything of the Spirit of God: he sees it all as nonsense;
    it is beyond his understanding because it can only be understood by means of
    the Spirit. &nbsp;A spiritual man, on the other hand, is able to judge the
    value of everything, and his own value is not to be judged by other men.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'You are the salt of the earth. But if salt
    becomes tasteless, what can make it salty again? It is good for nothing, and
    can only be thrown out to be trampled underfoot by men. 'You are the light
    of the world. A city built on a hill-top cannot be hidden. No one lights a
    lamp to put it under a tub; they put it on the lamp-stand where it shines
    for everyone in the house. In the same way your light must shine in the
    sight of men, so that, seeing your good works, they may give the praise to
    your Father in heaven. 'Do not imagine that I have come to abolish the Law
    or the Prophets. I have come not to abolish but to complete them. I tell you
    solemnly, till heaven and earth disappear, not one dot, not one little
    stroke, shall disappear from the Law until its purpose is achieved.
    Therefore, the man who infringes even one of the least of these commandments
    and teaches others to do the same will be considered the least in the
    kingdom of heaven; but the man who keeps them and teaches them will be
    considered great in the kingdom of heaven.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'It is not those who say to me, "Lord, Lord",
    who will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the person who does the will of my
    Father in heaven. When the day comes many will say to me, "Lord, Lord, did
    we not prophesy in your name, cast out demons in your name, work many
    miracles in your name?" Then I shall tell them to their faces: I have never
    known you; away from me, you evil men!' 'Therefore, everyone who listens to
    these words of mine and acts on them will be like a sensible man who built
    his house on rock. Rain came down, floods rose, gales blew and hurled
    themselves against that house, and it did not fall: it was founded on rock.
    But everyone who listens to these words of mine and does not act on them
    will be like a stupid man who built his house on sand. Rain came down,
    floods rose, gales blew and struck that house, and it fell; and what a fall
    it had!' Jesus had now finished what he wanted to say, and his teaching made
    a deep impression on the people because he taught them with authority, and
    not like their own scribes.

    Jesus said to the crowds: 'Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet
    cast into the sea that brings in a haul of all kinds. When it is full, the
    fishermen haul it ashore; then, sitting down, they collect the good ones in
    a basket and throw away those that are no use. This is how it will be at the
    end of time: the angels will appear and separate the wicked from the just to
    throw them into the blazing furnace where there will be weeping and grinding
    of teeth. 'Have you understood all this?' They said, 'Yes'. And he said to
    them, 'Well then, every scribe who becomes a disciple of the kingdom of
    heaven is like a householder who brings out from his storeroom things both
    new and old'.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'You must not allow yourselves to be called

    Jesus began to teach by the lakeside, but such a huge crowd gathered round
    him that he got into a boat on the lake and sat there. The people were all
    along the shore, at the water's edge. He taught them many things in
    parables, and in the course of his teaching he said to them, 'Listen!,
    Imagine a sower going out to sow. Now it happened that, as he sowed, some of
    the seed fell on the edge of the path, and the birds came and ate it up.
    Some seed fell on rocky ground where it found little soil and sprang up
    straightaway, because there was no depth of earth; and when the sun came up
    it was scorched and, not having any roots, it withered away. Some seed fell
    into thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it produced no crop.
    And some seeds fell into rich soil and, growing tall and strong, produced
    crop; and yielded thirty, sixty, even a hundredfold.' And he said, 'Listen,
    anyone who has ears to hear!' When he was alone, the Twelve, together with
    the others who formed his company, asked what the parables meant.
  </p>
  <p>
    He said to them, 'Do you not understand this parable? Then how will you
    understand any of the parables? What the sower is sowing is the word. Those
    on the edge of the path where the word is sown are people who have no sooner
    heard it than Satan comes and carries away the word that was sown in them.
    Similarly, those who receive the seed on patches of rock are people who,
    when first they hear the word, welcome it at once with joy. But they have no
    root in them, they do not last; should some trial come, or some persecution
    on account of the word, they fall away at once. Then there are others who
    receive the seed in thorns. These have heard the word, but the worries of
    this world, the lure of riches and all the other passions come in to choke
    the word, and so it produces nothing. And there are those who have received
    the seed in rich soil: they hear the word and accept it and yield a harvest,
    thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.'
