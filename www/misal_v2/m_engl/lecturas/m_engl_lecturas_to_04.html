    Seek the Lord, all you, the humble of the earth, who obey his commands. Seek

    Take yourselves for instance, brothers, at the time when you were called:
    how many of you were wise in the ordinary sense of the word, how many were
    influential people, or came from noble families? No, it was to shame the
    wise that God chose what is foolish by human reckoning, and to shame what is
    strong that he chose what is weak by human reckoning; those whom the world
    thinks common and contemptible are the ones that God has chosen - those who
    are nothing at all to show up those who are everything. The human race has
    nothing to boast about to God, but you, God has made members of Christ Jesus
    and by God's doing he has become our wisdom, and our virtue, and our
    holiness, and our freedom. As scripture says: if anyone wants to boast, let
    him boast about the Lord.

    Seeing the crowds, Jesus went up the hill. There he sat down and was joined
    by his disciples. Then he began to speak. This is what he taught them: 'How
    happy are the poor in spirit; theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Happy the
    gentle: they shall have the earth for their heritage. Happy those who mourn:
    they shall be comforted. &nbsp;Happy those who hunger and thirst for what is
    right: they shall be satisfied. Happy the merciful: they shall have mercy
    shown them. Happy the pure in heart: they shall see God. Happy the
    peacemakers: they shall be called sons of God. Happy those who are
    persecuted in the cause of right: theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 'Happy
    are you when people abuse you and persecute you and speak all kinds of
    calumny against you on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will
    be great in heaven.

    I would like to see you free from all worry. An unmarried man can devote
    himself to the Lord's affairs, all he need worry about is pleasing the Lord;
    but a married man has to bother about the world's affairs and devote himself
    to pleasing his wife: he is torn two ways. In the same way an unmarried
    woman, like a young girl, can devote herself to the Lord's affairs; all she
    need worry about is being holy in body and spirit. The married woman, on the
    other hand, has to worry about the world's affairs and devote herself to
    pleasing her husband. I say this only to help you, not to put a halter round
    your necks, but simply to make sure that everything is as it should be, and
    that you give your undivided attention to the Lord.

    In the city of Capernaum, on a Sabbath, Jesus went to the synagogue and
    began to teach. And his teaching made a deep impression on them because,
    unlike the scribes, he taught them with authority In their synagogue just
    then there was a man possessed by an unclean spirit and it shouted, 'What do
    you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who
    you are: the Holy One of God.' But Jesus said sharply, 'Be quiet! Come out
    of him!' And the unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions and with a
    loud cry went out of him. The people were so astonished that they started
    asking each other what it all meant. 'Here is a teaching that is new' they
    said 'and with authority behind it: he gives orders even to unclean spirits
    and they obey him.' And his reputation rapidly spread everywhere, through
    all the surrounding Galilean countryside.

    Be ambitious for the higher gifts. And I am going to show you a way that is
    better than any of them. If I have all the eloquence of men or of angels,
    but speak without love, I am simply a gong booming or a cymbal clashing. If
    I have the gift of prophecy, understanding all the mysteries there are, and
    knowing everything, and if I have faith in all its fullness, to move
    mountains, but without love, then I am nothing at all. If I give away all
    that I possess, piece by piece, and if I even let them take my body to burn
    it, but am without love, it will do me no good whatever. Love is always
    patient and kind; it is never jealous; love is never boastful or conceited;
    it is never rude or selfish; it does not take offence, and is not resentful.
    &nbsp;Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins but delights in the
    truth; it is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure
    whatever comes. Love does not come to an end. But if there are gifts of
    prophecy, the time will come when they must fail; or the gift of languages,
    it will not continue for ever; and knowledge - for this, too, the time will
    come when it must fail. &nbsp;For our knowledge is imperfect and our
    prophesying is imperfect; but once perfection comes, all imperfect things
    will disappear. When I was a child, I used to talk like a child, and think
    like a child, and argue like a child, but now I am a man, all childish ways
    are put behind me. Now we are seeing a dim reflection in a mirror; but then
    we shall be seeing face to face. The knowledge that I have now is imperfect;
    but then I shall know as fully as I am known. &nbsp;In short, there are
    three things that last: faith, hope and love; and the greatest of these is
    love.

    Jesus began to speak in the synagogue, 'This text is being fulfilled today
    even as you listen'. &nbsp;And he won the approval of all, and they were
    astonished by the gracious words that came from his lips They said, 'This is
    Joseph's son, surely?' But he replied, 'No doubt you will quote me the
    saying, "Physician, heal yourself" and tell me, "We have heard all that
    happened in Capernaum, do the same here in your own countryside"'. And he
    went on, 'I tell you solemnly, no prophet is ever accepted in his own
    country. 'There were many widows in Israel, I can assure you, in Elijah's
    day, when heaven remained shut for three years and six months and a great
    famine raged throughout the land, but Elijah was not sent to any one of
    these: he was sent to a widow at Zarephath, a Sidonian town. And in the
    prophet Elisha's time there were many lepers in Israel, but none of these
    was cured, except the Syrian, Naaman.' When they heard this everyone in the
    synagogue was enraged. They sprang to their feet and hustled him out of the
    town; and they took him up to the brow of the hill their town was built on,
    intending to throw him down the cliff, but he slipped through the crowd and
    walked away.

    Is there any need to say more? There is not time for me to give an account
    of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, or of David, Samuel and the prophets.
    These were men who through faith conquered kingdoms, did what is right and
    earned the promises. They could keep a lion's mouth shut, put out blazing
    fires and emerge unscathed from battle. They were weak people who were given
    strength, to be brave in war and drive back foreign invaders. Some came back
    to their wives from the dead, by resurrection; and others submitted to
    torture, refusing release so that they would rise again to a better life.
    Some had to bear being pilloried and flogged, or even chained up in prison.
    They were stoned, or sawn in half, or beheaded; they were homeless, and
    dressed in the skins of sheep and goats; they were penniless and were given
    nothing but ill-treatment. They were too good for the world and they went
    out to live in deserts and mountains and in caves and ravines. These are all
    heroes of faith, but they did not receive what was promised, since God had
    made provision for us to have something better, and they were not to reach
    perfection except with us.

    A messenger came to tell David, 'The hearts of the men of Israel are now
    with Absalom.' So David said to all his officers who were with him in
    Jerusalem, 'Let us be off, let us fly, or we shall never escape from
    Absalom. Leave as quickly as you can in case he mounts a surprise attack and
    worsts us and puts the city to the sword.' David then made his way up the
    Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, his head covered and his feet bare. And
    all the people with him had their heads covered and made their way up,
    weeping as they went. As David was reaching Bahurim, out came a man of the
    same clan as Saul's family. His name was Shimei son of Gera, and as he came
    he uttered curse after curse and threw stones at David and at all King
    David's officers, though the whole army and all the champions flanked the
    king right and left. The words of his curse were these, 'Be off, be off, man
    of blood, scoundrel! The Lord has brought on you all the blood of the House
    of Saul whose sovereignty you have usurped; and the Lord has transferred
    that same sovereignty to Absalom your son. Now your doom has overtaken you,
    man of blood that you are.' Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, 'Is
    this dead dog to curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut his head
    off.' But the king replied, 'What business is it of mine and yours, sons of
    Zeruiah? Let him curse. If the Lord said to him, "Curse David", what right
    has anyone to say, "Why have you done this?"' David said to Abishai and all
    his officers, 'Why, my own son, sprung from my body, is now seeking my life;
    so now how much the more this Benjaminite? Let him curse on if the Lord has
    told him to. Perhaps the Lord will look on my misery and repay me with good
    for his curse today.' So David and his men went on their way.

    Jesus and his disciples reached the country of the Gerasenes on the other
    side of the lake, and no sooner had he left the boat than a man with an
    unclean spirit came out from the tombs towards him. The man lived in the
    tombs and no one could secure him any more, even with a chain; because he
    had often been secured with fetters and chains but had snapped the chains
    and broken the fetters, and no one had the strength to control him. All
    night and all day, among the tombs and in the mountains, he would howl and
    gash himself with stones. Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran up
    and fell at his feet and shouted at the top of his voice, 'What do you want
    with me, Jesus, son of the Most High God? Swear by God you will not torture
    me!' - For Jesus had been saying to him, 'Come out of the man, unclean
    spirit'. 'What is your name?' Jesus asked. 'My name is legion,' he answered
    'for there are many of us.' And he begged him earnestly not to send them out
    of the district. Now there was there on the mountainside a great herd of
    pigs feeding, and the unclean spirits begged him, 'Send us to the pigs, let
    us go into them'. So he gave them leave. With that, the unclean spirits came
    out and went into the pigs, and the herd of about two thousand pigs charged
    down the cliff into the lake, and there they were drowned. The swineherds
    ran off and told their story in the town and in the country round about; and
    the people came to see what had really happened. They came to Jesus and saw
    the demoniac sitting there, clothed and in his full senses - the very man
    who had had the legion in him before - and they were afraid. And those who
    had witnessed it reported what had happened to the demoniac and what had
    become of the pigs. Then they began to implore Jesus to leave the
    neighbourhood. As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been
    possessed begged to be allowed to stay with him. Jesus would not let him but
    said to him, 'Go home to your people and tell them all that the Lord in his
    mercy has done for you'. So the man went off and proceeded to spread
    throughout the Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him. And everyone was
    amazed.

    With so many witnesses in a great cloud on every side of us, we too, then,
    should throw off everything that hinders us, especially the sin that clings
    so easily, and keep running steadily in the race we have started.&nbsp;Let

    Absalom happened to run into some of David's followers. Absalom was riding a
    mule and the mule passed under the thick branches of a great oak. Absalom's
    head caught fast in the oak and he was left hanging between heaven and
    earth, while the mule he was riding went on. Someone saw this and told Joab.
    'I have just seen Absalom' he said 'hanging from an oak.' And Joab took
    three lances in his hand and thrust them into Absalom's heart. David was
    sitting between the two gates. The lookout had gone up to the roof of the
    gate, on the ramparts; he looked up and saw a man running all by himself.
    The watch called out to the king and told him. The king said, 'If he is by
    himself, he has good news to tell'. As the man drew still nearer, The king
    said, 'Move aside and stand there'. He moved aside and stood waiting. Then
    the Cushite arrived. 'Good news for my lord the king!' cried the Cushite.
    'The Lord has vindicated your cause today by ridding you of all who rebelled
    against you.' 'Is all well with young Absalom?' the king asked the Cushite.
    'May the enemies of my lord the king' the Cushite answered 'and all who
    rebelled against you to your hurt, share the lot of that young man.' The
    king shuddered. He went up to the room over the gate and burst into tears,
    and weeping said, 'My son Absalom! My son! My son Absalom! Would I had died
    in your place! Absalom, my son, my son!' Word was brought to Joab, 'The king
    is now weeping and mourning for Absalom'. And the day's victory was turned
    to mourning for all the troops, because they learned that the king was
    grieving for his son. And the troops returned stealthily that day to the
    town, as troops creep back ashamed when routed in battle.

    When Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd
    gathered round him and he stayed by the lakeside. Then one of the synagogue
    officials came up, Jairus by name, and seeing him, fell at his feet and
    pleaded with him earnestly, saying, 'My little daughter is desperately sick.
    Do come and lay your hands on her to make her better and save her life.'
    Jesus went with him and a large crowd followed him; they were pressing all
    round him. Now there was a woman who had suffered from a haemorrhage for
    twelve years; after long and painful treatment under various doctors, she
    spent all she had without being any the better for it, in fact, she was
    getting worse. She had heard about Jesus, and she came up behind him through
    the crowd and touched his cloak. 'If I can touch even his clothes,' she had
    told herself 'I shall be well again.' And the source of the bleeding dried
    up instantly, and she felt in herself that she was cured of her complaint.
    Immediately aware that power had gone out from him, Jesus turned round in
    the crowd and said, 'Who touched my clothes?' His disciples said to him,
    'You see how the crowd is pressing round you and yet you say, "Who touched
    me?"' But he continued to look all round to see who had done it. Then the
    woman came forward, frightened and trembling because she knew what had
    happened to her, and she fell at his feet and told him the whole truth. 'My
    daughter,' he said 'your faith has restored you to health; go in peace and
    be free from your complaint.' While he was still speaking some people
    arrived from the house of the synagogue official to say, 'Your daughter is
    dead: why put the Master to any further trouble?' But Jesus had overheard
    this remark of theirs and he said to the official, 'Do not be afraid; only
    have faith'. And he allowed no one to go with him except Peter and James and
    John the brother of James. So they came to the official's house and Jesus
    noticed all the commotion, with people weeping and wailing unrestrainedly.
    He went in and said to them, 'Why all this commotion and crying? The child
    is not dead, but asleep.' But they laughed at him. So he turned them all out
    and, taking with him the child's father and mother and his own companions,
    he went into the place where the child lay. And taking the child by the hand
    he said to her, 'Talitha, kum!' which means, 'Little girl, I tell you to get
    up'. The little girl got up at once and began to walk about, for she was
    twelve years old. At this they were overcome with astonishment, and he
    ordered them strictly not to let anyone know about it, and told them to give
    her something to eat.

    In the fight against sin, you have not yet had to keep fighting to the point
    of death. Have you forgotten that encouraging text in which you are
    addressed as sons? My son, when the Lord corrects you, do not treat it
    lightly; but do not get discouraged when he reprimands you. For the Lord
    trains the ones that he loves and he punishes all those that he acknowledges
    as his sons. Suffering is part of your training; God is treating you as his
    sons. Has there ever been any son whose father did not train him? Of course,
    any punishment is most painful at the time, and far from pleasant; but
    later, in those on whom it has been used, it bears fruit in peace and
    goodness. So hold up your limp arms and steady your trembling knees and
    smooth out the path you tread; then the injured limb will not be wrenched,
    it will grow strong again. Always be wanting peace with all people, and the
    holiness without which no one can ever see the Lord. Be careful that no one
    is deprived of the grace of God and that no root of bitterness should begin
    to grow and make trouble; this can poison a whole community.

    King David said to Joab and to the senior army officers who were with him,
    'Now go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and take a
    census of the people; I wish to know the size of the population.' Joab gave
    the king the figures for the census of the people; Israel numbered eight
    hundred thousand armed men capable of drawing sword, and Judah five hundred
    thousand men. But afterwards David's heart misgave him for having taken a
    census of the people. 'I have committed a grave sin' David said to the Lord.
    'But now, Lord, I beg you to forgive your servant for this fault. I have
    been very foolish.' But when David got up next morning, the following
    message had come from the Lord to the prophet Gad, David's seer, 'Go and say
    to David, "the Lord says this: I offer you three things; choose one of them
    for me to do to you".' So Gad went to David and told him. 'Are three years
    of famine to come on you in your country' he said 'or will you flee for
    three months before your pursuing enemy, or would you rather have three
    days' pestilence in your country? Now think, and decide how I am to answer
    him who sends me.' David said to Gad, 'This is a hard choice. But let us
    rather fall into the power of the Lord, since his mercy is great, and not
    into the power of men.' So David chose pestilence. It was the time of the
    wheat harvest. The Lord sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning till
    the time appointed and plague ravaged the people, and from Dan to Beersheba
    seventy thousand men of them died. The angel stretched out his hand towards
    Jerusalem to destroy it, but the Lord thought better of this evil, and he
    said to the angel who was destroying the people, 'Enough! Now withdraw your
    hand.' The angel of the Lord was beside the threshing-floor of Araunah the
    Jebusite. When David saw the angel who was ravaging the people, he spoke to
    the Lord. 'It was I who sinned;' he said 'I who did this wicked thing. But
    these, this flock, what have they done? Let your hand lie heavy on me then,
    and on my family.'

    Jesus went to his home town and his disciples accompanied him. With the
    coming of the sabbath he began teaching in the synagogue and most of them
    were astonished when they heard him. They said, 'Where did the man get all
    this? What is this wisdom that has been granted him, and these miracles that
    are worked through him? This is the carpenter, surely, the son of Mary, the
    brother of James and Joset and Jude and Simon? His sisters, too, are they
    not here with us?' And they would not accept him. And Jesus said to them, 'A
    prophet is only despised in his own country, among his own relations and in
    his own house'; and he could work no miracle there, though he cured a few
    sick people by laying his hands on them. He was amazed at their lack of
    faith.

    As David's life drew to its close he laid this charge on his son Solomon, 'I
    am going the way of all the earth. Be strong and show yourself a man.
    Observe the injunctions of the Lord your God, following his ways and keeping
    his laws, his commandments, his customs and his decrees, as it stands
    written in the Law of Moses, that so you may be successful in all you do and
    undertake, so that the Lord may fulfill the promise he made me, If your sons
    are careful how they behave, and walk loyally before me with all their heart
    and soul, you shall never lack for a man on the throne of Israel'. So David
    slept with his ancestors and was buried in the Citadel of David. David's
    reign over Israel lasted forty years: he reigned in Hebron for seven years,
    and in Jerusalem for thirty-three. Solomon was seated upon the throne of
    David, and his sovereignty was securely established.

    Jesus summoned the Twelve and began to send them out in pairs giving them
    authority over the unclean spirits. And he instructed them to take nothing
    for the journey except a staff - no bread, no haversack, no coppers for
    their purses. They were to wear sandals but, he added, 'Do not take a spare
    tunic'. And he said to them, 'If you enter a house anywhere, stay there
    until you leave the district. And if any place does not welcome you and
    people refuse to listen to you, as you walk away shake off the dust from
    under your feet as a sign to them.' So they set off to preach repentance;
    and they cast out many devils, and anointed many sick people with oil and
    cured them.

    Continue to love each other like brothers, and remember always to welcome
    strangers, for by doing this, some people have entertained angels without
    knowing it. Keep in mind those who are in prison, as though you were in
    prison with them; and those who are being badly treated, since you too are
    in the one body. Marriage is to be honored by all, and marriages are to be
    kept undefiled, because fornicators and adulterers will come under God's
    judgment. Put greed out of your lives and be content with whatever you have;
    God himself has said: I will not fail you or desert you, and so we can say
    with confidence: With the Lord to help me, I fear nothing: what can man do
    to me? Remember your leaders, who preached the word of God to you, and as
    you reflect on the outcome of their lives, imitate their faith. Jesus Christ

    As the fat is set apart from the communion sacrifice, so David was chosen
    out of all the sons of Israel. He played with lions as though with kids, and
    with bears as though with lambs of the flock. While still a boy, did he not
    slay the giant, and relieve the people of their shame, by putting out a hand
    to sling a stone which brought down the arrogance of Goliath? For he called
    on the Lord Most High, who gave strength to his right arm to put a mighty
    warrior to death, and lift up the horn of his people. Hence they gave him
    credit for ten thousand, and praised him while they blessed the Lord, by
    offering him a crown of glory; for he massacred enemies on every side, he
    annihilated his foes the Philistines, and crushed their horn to this very
    day. In all his activities he gave thanks to the Holy One, the Most High, in
    words of glory; he put all his heart into his songs out of love for his
    Maker. He placed harps before the altar to make the singing sweeter with
    their music; he gave the feasts their splendour, the festivals their solemn
    pomp, causing the Lord's holy name to be praised and the sanctuary to
    resound from dawn. The Lord took away his sins, and exalted his horn for

    King Herod had heard about Jesus, since by now his name was well-known. Some
    were saying, John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and that is why
    miraculous powers are at work in him'. Others said, 'He is Elijah'; others
    again, 'He is a prophet, like the prophets we used to have'. But when Herod
    heard this he said, 'It is John whose head I cut off; he has risen from the
    dead'. Now it was this same Herod who had sent to have John arrested, and
    had him chained up in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife
    whom he had married. For John had told Herod, 'It is against the law for you
    to have your brother's wife'. As for Herodias, she was furious with him and
    wanted to kill him; but she was not able to, because Herod was afraid of
    John, knowing him to be a good and holy man, and gave him his protection.
    When he had heard him speak he was greatly perplexed, and yet he liked to
    listen to him. An opportunity came on Herod's birthday when he gave a
    banquet for the nobles of his court, for his army officers and for the
    leading figures in Galilee. When the daughter of this same Herodias came in
    and danced, she delighted Herod and his guests; so the king said to the
    girl, 'Ask me anything you like and I will give it you'. And he swore her an
    oath, 'I will give you anything you ask, even half my kingdom'. She went out
    and said to her mother, 'What shall I ask for?' She replied, 'The head of
    John the Baptist' The girl hurried straight back to the king and made her
    request, 'I want you to give me John the Baptist's head, here and now, on a
    dish'. The king was deeply distressed but, thinking of the oaths he had
    sworn and of his guests, he was reluctant to break his word to her. So the
    king at once sent one of the bodyguard with orders to bring John's head. The
    man went off and beheaded him in prison; then he brought the head on a dish
    and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. When John's
    disciples heard about this, they came and took his body and laid it in a
    tomb.

    Through Jesus, let us offer God an unending sacrifice of praise, a verbal
    sacrifice that is offered every time we acknowledge his name. Keep doing
    good works and sharing your resources, for these are sacrifices that please
    God. Obey your leaders and do as they tell you, because they must give an
    account of the way they look after your souls; make this a joy for them to
    do, and not a grief - you yourselves would be the losers. I pray that the
    God of peace, who brought our Lord Jesus back from the dead to become the
    great Shepherd of the sheep by the blood that sealed an eternal covenant,
    may make you ready to do his will in any kind of good action; and turn us
    all into whatever is acceptable to himself through Jesus Christ, to whom be
    glory for ever and ever, Amen.

  <p class="Areadingfrom">
    A reading from the first&nbsp;Book of Kings<span class="alindcha">3:4-13</span>
  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    King Solomon went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, since that was the greatest
    of the high places - he offered a thousand holocausts on that altar. At
    Gibeon the Lord appeared in a dream to Solomon during the night. God said,
    'Ask what you would like me to give you'. Solomon replied, 'You showed great
    kindness to your servant David, my father, when he lived his life before you
    in faithfulness and justice and integrity of heart; you have continued this
    great kindness to him by allowing a son of his to sit on his throne today.
    Now, the Lord my God, you have made your servant king in succession to David
    my father. But I am a very young man, unskilled in leadership. Your servant
    finds himself in the midst of this people of yours that you have chosen, a
    people so many its number cannot be counted or reckoned. Give your servant a
    heart to understand how to discern between good and evil, for who could
    govern this people of yours that is so great?' It pleased the Lord that
    Solomon should have asked for this. 'Since you have asked for this' the Lord
    said 'and not asked for long life for yourself or riches or the lives of
    your enemies, but have asked for a discerning judgement for yourself, here
    and now I do what you ask. I give you a heart wise and shrewd as none before
    you has had and none will have after you. What you have not asked I shall
    give you too: such riches and glory as no other king ever had.

    The apostles rejoined Jesus and told him all they had done and taught. Then
    he said to them, 'You must come away to some lonely place all by yourselves
    and rest for a while'; for there were so many coming and going that the
    apostles had no time even to eat. So they went off in a boat to a lonely
    place where they could be by themselves. But people saw them going, and many
    could guess where; and from every town they all hurried to the place on foot
    and reached it before them. So as he stepped ashore he saw a large crowd;
    and he took pity on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd,
    and he set himself to teach them at some length.
