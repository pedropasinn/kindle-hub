    The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham:
    &nbsp;Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the
    father of Judah and his brothers, &nbsp;Judah was the father of Perez and
    Zerah, Tamar being their mother, Perez was the father of Hezron, Hezron the
    father of Ram,&nbsp;Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of
    Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon, &nbsp;Salmon was the father of Boaz,
    Rahab being his mother, Boaz was the father of Obed, Ruth being his mother,
    Obed was the father of Jesse; &nbsp;and Jesse was the father of King David.
    David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife,
    &nbsp;Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah,
    Abijah the father of Asa, &nbsp;Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat,
    Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, Joram the father of Azariah, &nbsp;Azariah
    was the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of
    Hezekiah, &nbsp;Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of
    Amon, Amon the father of Josiah; &nbsp;and Josiah was the father of
    Jechoniah and his brothers. Then the deportation to Babylon took place.
    &nbsp;After the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah was the father of
    Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,&nbsp;Zerubbabel was the
    father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,
    &nbsp;Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, Achim the
    father of Eliud, &nbsp;Eliud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father
    of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob; &nbsp;and Jacob was the father of
    Joseph the husband of Mary; of her was born Jesus who is called Christ.
    &nbsp;Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother
    Mary had been betrothed to Joseph; before they came together she was found
    to be with child of the Holy Spirit; &nbsp;and her husband Joseph; being a
    just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to send her away
    quietly. &nbsp;But as he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord
    appeared to him in a dream, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, do not fear to
    take Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy
    Spirit. &nbsp;She will bear and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will
    save his people from their sins.' &nbsp;All this took place to fulfill what
    the Lord had spoken by the prophet: &nbsp;'Behold, a virgin shall conceive
    and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel, (which means 'God
    with us'. )

    On the way the people lost patience. &nbsp;They spoke against God and

    wilderness? For there is neither bread nor water here; we are sick of this
    unsatisfying food.' &nbsp;At this God sent fiery serpents among the people;
    their bite brought death to many in Israel. &nbsp;The people came and said
    to Moses, 'We have sinned by speaking against the Lord and against you.
    Intercede for us with the Lord to save us from these serpents.' Moses
    interceded for the people, &nbsp;and the Lord answered him, 'Make a fiery
    serpent and put it on a standard. If anyone is bitten and looks at it, he

    As the child's father and mother stood there wondering at the things that
    were being said about him, Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother,
    'You see this child: he is destined for the fall and for the rising of many
    in Israel, destined to be a sign that is rejected- and a sword will pierce
    your own soul too-so that the secret thoughts of many may be laid bare'.

    Remember all the sufferings that you had to meet after you received the
    light, in earlier days; sometimes by being yourselves publicly exposed to
    insults and violence, and sometimes as associates of others who were treated
    in the same way. For you not only shared in the sufferings of those who were
    in prison, but you happily accepted being stripped of your belongings,
    knowing that you owned something that was better and lasting. Be as
    confident now, then, since the reward is so great. You will need endurance
    to do God's will and gain what he has promised.

    I, the prisoner in the Lord, implore you therefore to lead a life worthy of
    your vocation. &nbsp;Bear with one another charitably, in complete
    selflessness, gentleness and patience. &nbsp;Do all you can to preserve the
    unity of the Spirit by the peace that binds you together. &nbsp;There is one
    Body, one Spirit, just as you were all called into one and the same hope
    when you were called. &nbsp;There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
    &nbsp;and one God who is Father of all, over all, through all and within
    all. &nbsp;Each one of us, however, has been given his own share of grace,
    given as Christ allotted it. &nbsp;And to some, his gift was that they
    should be apostles; to some, prophets; to some, evangelists; to some,
    pastors and teachers; &nbsp;so that the saints together make a unity in the
    work of service, building up the body of Christ. &nbsp;In this way we are
    all to come to unity in our faith and in our knowledge of the Son of God,
    until we become the perfect Man, fully mature with the fullness of Christ
    himself.

    As Jesus was walking on from there he saw a man named Matthew sitting by the
    customs house, and he said to him, 'Follow me'. And he got up and followed
    him. &nbsp;While he was at dinner in the house it happened that a number of
    tax collectors and sinners came to sit at the table with Jesus and his
    disciples. &nbsp;When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples,
    'Why does your master eat with tax collectors and sinners?' &nbsp;When he
    heard this he replied, 'It is not the healthy who need the doctor, but the
    sick. &nbsp;Go and learn the meaning of the words: What I want is mercy, not
    sacrifice. And indeed I did not come to call the virtuous, but sinners.'
