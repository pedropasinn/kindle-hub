    Resentment and anger, these are foul things too, and both are found with the
    sinner. &nbsp;He who exacts vengeance will experience the vengeance of the
    Lord, who keeps strict account of sin. &nbsp;Forgive your neighbour the hurt
    he does you, and when you pray, your sins will be forgiven. &nbsp;If a man
    nurses anger against another, can he then demand compassion from the Lord?
    &nbsp;Showing no pity for a man like himself, can he then plead for his own
    sins? &nbsp;Mere creature of flesh, he cherishes resentment; who will
    forgive him his sins? &nbsp;Remember the last things, and stop hating,
    remember dissolution and death, and live by the commandments. &nbsp;Remember
    the commandments, and do not bear your neighbour ill-will; remember the
    covenant of the Most High, and overlook the offence.

    Peter went up to Jesus and said, 'Lord, how often must I forgive my brother
    if he wrongs me? As often as seven times?' &nbsp;Jesus answered, 'Not seven,
    I tell you, but seventy-seven times. &nbsp;'And so the kingdom of heaven may
    be compared to a king who decided to settle his accounts with his servants.
    &nbsp;When the reckoning began, they brought him a man who owed ten thousand
    talents; &nbsp;but he had no means of paying, so his master gave orders that
    he should be sold, together with his wife and children and all his
    possessions, to meet the debt. &nbsp;At this, the servant threw himself down
    at his master's feet. "Give me time" he said "and I will pay the whole sum."
    &nbsp;And the servant's master felt so sorry for him that he let him go and
    cancelled the debt. &nbsp;Now as this servant went out, he happened to meet
    a fellow servant who owed him one hundred denarii; and he seized him by the
    throat and began to throttle him. "Pay what you owe me" he said. &nbsp;His
    fellow servant fell at his feet and implored him, saying, "Give me time and
    I will pay you". &nbsp;But the other would not agree; on the contrary, he
    had him thrown into prison till he should pay the debt. &nbsp;His fellow
    servants were deeply distressed when they saw what had happened, and they
    went to their master and reported the whole affair to him. &nbsp;Then the
    master sent for him. "You wicked servant," he said "I cancelled all that
    debt of yours when you appealed to me. &nbsp;Were you not bound, then, to
    have pity on your fellow servant just as I had pity on you?" &nbsp;And in
    his anger the master handed him over to the torturers till he should pay all
    his debt. &nbsp;And that is how my heavenly Father will deal with you unless
    you each forgive your brother from your heart.'

    Take the case, my brothers, of someone who has never done a single good act
    but claims that he has faith. Will that faith save him? &nbsp;If one of the
    brothers or one of the sisters is in need of clothes and has not enough food
    to live on, &nbsp;and one of you says to them, 'I wish you well; keep
    yourself warm and eat plenty', without giving them these bare necessities of
    life, then what good is that? &nbsp;Faith is like that: if good works do not
    go with it, it is quite dead. &nbsp;This is the way to talk to people of
    that kind: 'You say you have faith and I have good deeds; I will prove to
    you that I have faith by showing you my good deeds - now you prove to me

    Jesus and his disciples left for the villages round Caesarea Philippi. On
    the way he put this question to his disciples, 'Who do people say I am?'
    &nbsp;And they told him. 'John the Baptist,' they said 'others Elijah;
    others again, one of the prophets.'&nbsp;'But you,' he asked 'who do you say
    I am?' Peter spoke up and said to him, 'You are the Christ'. &nbsp;And he
    gave them strict orders not to tell anyone about him. &nbsp;And he began to
    teach them that the Son of Man was destined to suffer grievously, to be
    rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and to be put
    to death, and after three days to rise again; &nbsp;and he said all this
    quite openly. Then, taking him aside, Peter started to remonstrate with him.
    &nbsp;But, turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said to
    him, 'Get behind me, Satan! Because the way you think is not God's way but
    man's.' &nbsp;He called the people and his disciples to him and said, 'If
    anyone wants to be a follower of mine, let him renounce himself and take up
    his cross and follow me. &nbsp;For anyone who wants to save his life will
    lose it; but anyone who loses his life for my sake, and for the sake of the
    gospel, will save it.

    marked out for them; they have made themselves a calf of molten metal and
    have worshipped it and offered it sacrifice. "Here is your God, Israel,"

    said to Moses, 'I can see how headstrong these people are! &nbsp;Leave me,
    now, my wrath shall blaze out against them and devour them; of you, however,
    I will make a great nation.' &nbsp;But Moses pleaded with the Lord his God.
    'Lord,' he said 'why should your wrath blaze out against this people of
    yours whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with arm outstretched and
    mighty hand? &nbsp;Remember Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, your servants to whom

    The tax collectors and the sinners were all seeking company of Jesus to hear
    what he had to say, &nbsp;and the Pharisees and the scribes complained.
    'This man' they said 'welcomes sinners and eats with them.' &nbsp;So he
    spoke this parable to them: &nbsp;'What man among you with a hundred sheep,
    losing one, would not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after
    the missing one till he found it? &nbsp;And when he found it, would he not
    joyfully take it on his shoulders &nbsp;and then, when he got home, call
    together his friends and neighbours? "Rejoice with me," he would say "I have
    found my sheep that was lost." &nbsp;In the same way, I tell you, there will
    be more rejoicing in heaven over one repentant sinner than over ninety-nine
    virtuous men who have no need of repentance. &nbsp;'Or again, what woman
    with ten drachmas would not, if she lost one, light a lamp and sweep out the
    house and search thoroughly till she found it? &nbsp;And then, when she had
    found it, call together her friends and neighbours? "Rejoice with me," she
    would say "I have found the drachma I lost." &nbsp;In the same way, I tell
    you, there is rejoicing among the angels of God over one repentant sinner.'
    &nbsp;He also said, 'A man had two sons. &nbsp;The younger said to his
    father, "Father, let me have the share of the estate that would come to me".
    So the father divided the property between them. &nbsp;A few days later, the
    younger son got together everything he had and left for a distant country
    where he squandered his money on a life of debauchery. &nbsp;'When he had
    spent it all, that country experienced a severe famine, and now he began to
    feel the pinch, &nbsp;so he hired himself out to one of the local
    inhabitants who put him on his farm to feed the pigs. &nbsp;And he would
    willingly have filled his belly with the husks the pigs were eating but no
    one offered him anything. &nbsp;Then he came to his senses and said, "How
    many of my father's paid servants have more food than they want, and here am
    I dying of hunger! &nbsp;I will leave is this place and go to my father and
    say: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you; &nbsp;I no longer
    deserve to be called your son; treat me as one of your paid servants."
    &nbsp;So he left the place and went back to his father. 'While he was still
    a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with pity. He ran to the
    boy, clasped him in his arms and kissed him tenderly. &nbsp;Then his son
    said, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I no longer
    deserve to be called your son." &nbsp;But the father said to his servants,
    "Quick! Bring out the best robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger
    and sandals on his feet. &nbsp;Bring the calf we have been fattening, and
    kill it; we are going to have a feast, a celebration, &nbsp;because this son
    of mine was dead and has come back to life; he was lost and is found." And
    they began to celebrate. &nbsp;'Now the elder son was out in the fields, and
    on his way back, as he drew near the house, he could hear music and dancing.
    &nbsp;Calling one of the servants he asked what it was all about.
    &nbsp;"Your brother has come" replied the servant "and your father has
    killed the calf we had fattened because he has got him back safe and sound."
    &nbsp;He was angry then and refused to go in, and his father came out to
    plead with him; &nbsp;but he answered his father, "Look, all these years I
    have slaved for you and never once disobeyed your orders, yet you never
    offered me so much as a kid for me to celebrate with my friends. &nbsp;But,
    for this son of yours, when he comes back after swallowing up your property
    - he and his women - you kill the calf we had been fattening." &nbsp;The
    father said, "My son, you are with me always and all I have is yours.
    &nbsp;But it was only right we should celebrate and rejoice, because your
    brother here was dead and has come to life; he was lost and is found."'

    joyfully take it on his shoulders &nbsp;and then, when he got home, call
    together his friends and neighbours? "Rejoice with me," he would say "I have
    found my sheep that was lost." &nbsp;In the same way, I tell you, there will
    be more rejoicing in heaven over one repentant sinner than over ninety-nine
    virtuous men who have no need of repentance. &nbsp;'Or again, what woman
    with ten drachmas would not, if she lost one, light a lamp and sweep out the
    house and search thoroughly till she found it? &nbsp;And then, when she had
    found it, call together her friends and neighbours? "Rejoice with me," she
    would say "I have found the drachma I lost." &nbsp;In the same way, I tell
    you, there is rejoicing among the angels of God over one repentant sinner.'

    My advice is that, first of all, there should be prayers offered for
    everyone - petitions, intercessions and thanksgiving - &nbsp;and especially
    for kings and others in authority, so that we may be able to live religious
    and reverent lives in peace and quiet. &nbsp;To do this is right, and will
    please God our saviour: &nbsp;he wants everyone to be saved and reach full
    knowledge of the truth. &nbsp;For there is only one God, and there is only
    one mediator between God and mankind, himself a man, Christ Jesus, &nbsp;who
    sacrificed himself as a ransom for them all. He is the evidence of this,
    sent at the appointed time, and &nbsp;I have been named a herald and apostle
    of it and - I am telling the truth and no lie - a teacher of the faith and
    the truth to the pagans. &nbsp;In every place, then, I want the men to lift
    their hands up reverently in prayer, with no anger or argument.

    On the subject of instructions, I cannot say that you have done well in
    holding meetings that do you more harm than good. &nbsp;In the first place,
    I hear that when you all come together as a community, there are separate
    factions among you, and I half believe it - &nbsp;since there must no doubt
    be separate groups among you, to distinguish those who are to be trusted.
    &nbsp;The point is, when you hold these meetings, it is not the Lord's
    Supper that you are eating, &nbsp;since when the time comes to eat, everyone
    is in such a hurry to start his own supper that one person goes hungry while
    another is getting drunk. &nbsp;Surely you have homes for eating and
    drinking in? Surely you have enough respect for the community of God not to
    make poor people embarrassed? What am I to say to you? Congratulate you? I
    cannot congratulate you on this. &nbsp;For this is what I received from the
    Lord, and in turn passed on to you: that on the same night that he was
    betrayed, the Lord Jesus took some bread, &nbsp;and thanked God for it and
    broke it, and he said, 'This is my body, which is for you; do this as a
    memorial of me'. &nbsp;In the same way he took the cup after supper, and
    said, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Whenever you drink it, do
    this as a memorial of me.' &nbsp;Until the Lord comes, therefore, every time
    you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are proclaiming his death.
    &nbsp;So to sum up, my dear brothers, when you meet for the Meal, wait for
    one another.

    When Jesus had come to the end of all he wanted the people to hear, he went
    into Capernaum. &nbsp;A centurion there had a servant, a favourite of his,
    who was sick and near death. &nbsp;Having heard about Jesus he sent some
    Jewish elders to him to ask him to come and heal his servant. &nbsp;When
    they came to Jesus they pleaded earnestly with him. 'He deserves this of
    you' they said &nbsp;'because he is friendly towards our people; in fact, he
    is the one who built the synagogue.' &nbsp;So Jesus went with them, and was
    not very far from the house when the centurion sent word to him by some
    friends: 'Sir,' he said 'do not put yourself to trouble; because I am not
    worthy to have you under my roof; &nbsp;and for this same reason I did not
    presume to come to you myself; but give the word and let my servant be
    cured. &nbsp;For I am under authority myself, and have soldiers under me;
    and I say to one man: Go, and he goes; to another: Come here, and he comes;
    to my servant: Do this, and he does it.' &nbsp;When Jesus heard these words
    he was astonished at him and, turning round, said to the crowd following
    him, 'I tell you, not even in Israel have I found faith like this'.
    &nbsp;And when the messengers got back to the house they found the servant
    in perfect health.

    Here is a saying that you can rely on: To want to be a presiding elder is to
    want to do a noble work.&nbsp;That is why the president must have an
    impeccable character. He must not have been married more than once, and he
    must be temperate, discreet and courteous, hospitable and a good teacher;
    &nbsp;not a heavy drinker, nor hot-tempered, but kind and peaceable. He must
    not be a lover of money. &nbsp;He must be a man who manages his own family
    well and brings his children up to obey him and be well-behaved: &nbsp;how
    can any man who does not understand how to manage his own family have
    responsibility for the church of God? &nbsp;He should not be a new convert,
    in case pride might turn his head and then he might be condemned as the
    devil was condemned. &nbsp;It is also necessary that people outside the
    Church should speak well of him, so that he never gets a bad reputation and
    falls into the devil's trap. &nbsp;In the same way, deacons must be
    respectable men whose word can be trusted, moderate in the amount of wine
    they drink and with no squalid greed for money. &nbsp;They must be
    conscientious believers in the mystery of the faith. &nbsp;They are to be
    examined first, and only admitted to serve as deacons if there is nothing
    against them. &nbsp;In the same way, the women must be respectable, not
    gossips but sober and quite reliable. &nbsp;Deacons must not have been
    married more than once, and must be men who manage their children and
    families well. &nbsp;Those of them who carry out their duties well as
    deacons will earn a high standing for themselves and be rewarded with great
    assurance in their work for the faith in Christ Jesus.

    Just as a human body, though it is made up of many parts, is a single unit

    is the body to be identified with any one of its many parts. &nbsp;Now you
    together are Christ's body; but each of you is a different part of it.
    &nbsp;In the Church, God has given the first place to apostles, the second
    to prophets, the third to teachers; after them, miracles, and after them the
    gift of healing; helpers, good leaders, those with many languages. &nbsp;Are

    Jesus went to a town called Nain, accompanied by his disciples and a great
    number of people. &nbsp;When he was near the gate of the town it happened
    that a dead man was being carried out for burial, the only son of his
    mother, and she was a widow. And a considerable number of the townspeople
    were with her. &nbsp;When the Lord saw her he felt sorry for her. 'Do not
    cry' he said. &nbsp;Then he went up and put his hand on the bier and the
    bearers stood still, and he said, 'Young man, I tell you to get up'.
    &nbsp;And the dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him to his
    mother. &nbsp;Everyone was filled with awe and praised God saying, 'A great
    prophet has appeared among us; God has visited his people'. &nbsp;And this
    opinion of him spread throughout Judaea and all over the countryside.

    fullness, to move mountains, but without love, then I am nothing at all.
    &nbsp;If I give away all that I possess, piece by piece, and if I even let
    them take my body to burn it, but am without love, it will do me no good
    whatever. &nbsp;Love is always patient and kind; it is never jealous; love
    is never boastful or conceited; &nbsp;it is never rude or selfish; it does
    not take offence, and is not resentful. &nbsp;Love takes no pleasure in
    other people's sins but delights in the truth; &nbsp;it is always ready to
    excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes. &nbsp;Love does not
    come to an end. But if there are gifts of prophecy, the time will come when
    they must fail; or the gift of languages, it will not continue for ever; and
    knowledge - for this, too, the time will come when it must fail. &nbsp;For
    our knowledge is imperfect and our prophesying is imperfect; &nbsp;but once
    perfection comes, all imperfect things will disappear. &nbsp;When I was a
    child, I used to talk like a child, and think like a child, and argue like a
    child, but now I am a man, all childish ways are put behind me. &nbsp;Now we
    are seeing a dim reflection in a mirror; but then we shall be seeing face to
    face. The knowledge that I have now is imperfect; but then I shall know as
    fully as I am known. &nbsp;In short, there are three things that last:
    faith, hope and love; and the greatest of these is love.

    gospel will save you only if you keep believing exactly what I preached to
    you - believing anything else will not lead to anything. &nbsp;Well then, in

    Christ died for our sins, in accordance with the scriptures; &nbsp;that he
    was buried; and that he was raised to life on the third day, in accordance
    with the scriptures; &nbsp;that he appeared first to Cephas and secondly to
    the Twelve. &nbsp;Next he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers
    at the same time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died;
    &nbsp;then he appeared to James, and then to all the apostles; &nbsp;and
    last of all he appeared to me too; it was as though I was born when no one
    expected it. &nbsp;I am the least of the apostles; in fact, since I
    persecuted the Church of God, I hardly deserve the name apostle; &nbsp;but
    by God's grace that is what I am, and the grace that he gave me has not been
    fruitless. On the contrary, I, or rather the grace of God that is with me,
    have worked harder than any of the others; &nbsp;but what matters is that I
    preach what they preach, and this is what you all believed.

    One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to a meal. When he arrived at the
    Pharisee's house and took his place at table, &nbsp;a woman came in, who had
    a bad name in the town. She had heard he was dining with the Pharisee and
    had brought with her an alabaster jar of ointment. &nbsp;She waited behind
    him at his feet, weeping, and her tears fell on his feet, and she wiped them
    away with her hair; then she covered his feet with kisses and anointed them
    with the ointment. &nbsp;When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he
    said to himself, 'If this man were a prophet, he would know who this woman
    is that is touching him and what a bad name she has'. &nbsp;Then Jesus took
    him up and said, 'Simon, I have something to say to you'. 'Speak, Master'
    was the reply. &nbsp;'There was once a creditor who had two men in his debt;
    one owed him five hundred denarii, the other fifty. &nbsp;They were unable
    to pay, so he pardoned them both. Which of them will love him more?'
    &nbsp;'The one who was pardoned more, I suppose' answered Simon. Jesus said,
    'You are right'. &nbsp;Then he turned to the woman. 'Simon,' he said 'you
    see this woman? I came into your house, and you poured no water over my
    feet, but she has poured out her tears over my feet and wiped them away with
    her hair. &nbsp;You gave me no kiss, but she has been covering my feet with
    kisses ever since I came in. &nbsp;You did not anoint my head with oil, but
    she has anointed my feet with ointment. &nbsp;For this reason I tell you
    that her sins, her many sins, must have been forgiven her, or she would not
    have shown such great love. It is the man who is forgiven little who shows
    little love.' &nbsp;Then he said to her, 'Your sins are forgiven'.
    &nbsp;Those who were with him at table began to say to themselves, 'Who is
    this man, that he even forgives sins?' &nbsp;But he said to the woman, 'Your
    faith has saved you; go in peace'.

    This is what you are to teach the brothers to believe and persuade them to
    do. &nbsp;Anyone who teaches anything different, and does not keep to the
    sound teaching which is that of our Lord Jesus Christ, the doctrine which is
    in accordance with true religion, &nbsp;is simply ignorant and must be full
    of self-conceit - with a craze for questioning everything and arguing about
    words. All that can come of this is jealousy, contention, abuse and wicked
    mistrust of one another; &nbsp;and unending disputes by people who are
    neither rational nor informed and imagine that religion is a way of making a
    profit. &nbsp;Religion, of course, does bring large profits, but only to
    those who are content with what they have. &nbsp;We brought nothing into the
    world, and we can take nothing out of it; &nbsp;but as long as we have food
    and clothing, let us be content with that. &nbsp;People who long to be rich
    are a prey to temptation; they get trapped into all sorts of foolish and
    dangerous ambitions which eventually plunge them into ruin and destruction.
    &nbsp;'The love of money is the root of all evils' and there are some who,
    pursuing it, have wandered away from the faith, and so given their souls any
    number of fatal wounds. &nbsp;But, as a man dedicated to God, you must avoid
    all that. You must aim to be saintly and religious, filled with faith and
    love, patient and gentle. &nbsp;Fight the good fight of the faith and win
    for yourself the eternal life to which you were called when you made your
    profession and spoke up for the truth in front of many witnesses.

    Before God the source of all life and before Christ, who spoke up as a
    witness for the truth in front of Pontius Pilate, I put to you the duty
    &nbsp;of doing all that you have been told, with no faults or failures,
    until the Appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,&nbsp;who at the due time will
    be revealed by God, the blessed and only Ruler of all, the King of kings and
    the Lord of lords, &nbsp;who alone is immortal, whose home is in
    inaccessible light, whom no man has seen and no man is able to see: to him
    be honour and everlasting power. Amen.

    A reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians<span

  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    Someone may ask, 'How are dead people raised, and what sort of body do they
    have when they come back?' &nbsp;They are stupid questions. Whatever you sow
    in the ground has to die before it is given new life &nbsp;and the thing
    that you sow is not what is going to come; you sow a bare grain, say of
    wheat or something like that. &nbsp;It is the same with the resurrection of
    the dead: the thing that is sown is perishable but what is raised is
    imperishable; &nbsp;the thing that is sown is contemptible but what is
    raised is glorious; the thing that is sown is weak but what is raised is
    powerful; &nbsp;when it is sown it embodies the soul, when it is raised it
    embodies the spirit. If the soul has its own embodiment, so does the spirit
    have its own embodiment. &nbsp;The first man, Adam, as scripture says,
    became a living soul; but the last Adam has become a life-giving spirit.
    &nbsp;That is, first the one with the soul, not the spirit, and after that,
    the one with the spirit. &nbsp;The first man, being from the earth, is
    earthly by nature; the second man is from heaven. &nbsp;As this earthly man
    was, so are we on earth; and as the heavenly man is, so are we in heaven.
    &nbsp;And we, who have been modelled on the earthly man, will be modelled on
    the heavenly man.

    With a large crowd gathering and people from every town finding their way to
    him, Jesus used this parable: &nbsp;'A sower went out to sow his seed. As he
    sowed, some fell on the edge of the path and was trampled on; and the birds
    of the air ate it up. &nbsp;Some seed fell on rock, and when it came up it
    withered away, having no moisture. &nbsp;Some seed fell amongst thorns and
    the thorns grew with it and choked it. &nbsp;And some seed fell into rich
    soil and grew and produced its crop a hundredfold.' Saying this he cried,
    'Listen, anyone who has ears to hear!' &nbsp;His disciples asked him what
    this parable might mean, &nbsp;and he said, The mysteries of the kingdom of
    God are revealed to you; for the rest there are only parables, so that they
    may see but not perceive, listen but not understand &nbsp;'This, then, is
    what the parable means: the seed is the word of God. &nbsp;Those on the edge
    of the path are people who have heard it, and then the devil comes and
    carries away the word from their hearts in case they should believe and be
    saved. &nbsp;Those on the rock are people who, when they first hear it,
    welcome the word with joy. But these have no root; they believe for a while,
    and in time of trial they give up. &nbsp;As for the part that fell into
    thorns, this is people who have heard, but as they go on their way they are
    choked by the worries and riches and pleasures of life and do not reach
    maturity. &nbsp;As for the part in the rich soil, this is people with a
    noble and generous heart who have heard the word and take it to themselves
    and yield a harvest through their perseverance.
