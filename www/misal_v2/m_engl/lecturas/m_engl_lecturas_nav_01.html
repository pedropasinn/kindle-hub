    About Zion I will not be silent, about Jerusalem I will not grow weary,
    until her integrity shines out like the dawn and her salvation flames like a
    torch. The nations then will see your integrity, all the kings your glory,
    and you will be called by a new name, one which the mouth of the Lord will
    confer. You are to be a crown of splendor in the hand of the Lord, a
    princely diadem in the hand of your God; no longer are you to be named
    'Forsaken', nor your land 'Abandoned', but you shall be called 'My Delight'
    and your land 'The Wedded'; for the Lord takes delight in you and your land
    will have its wedding. Like a young man marrying a virgin, so will the one
    who built you wed you, and as the bridegroom rejoices in his bride, so will

    When Paul reached Antioch in Pisidia, he stood up in the synagogue, held up
    a hand for silence and began to speak: 'Men of Israel, and fearers of God,
    listen! The God of our nation Israel chose our ancestors, and made our
    people great when they were living as foreigners in Egypt; then by divine
    power he led them out, Then he made David their king, of whom he approved in
    these words, "I have selected David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart,
    who will carry out my whole purpose". To keep his promise, God has raised up
    for Israel one of David's descendants, Jesus, as Saviour, whose coming was
    heralded by John when he proclaimed a baptism of repentance for the whole
    people of Israel. Before John ended his career he said, "I am not the one
    you imagine me to be; that one is coming after me and I am not fit to undo
    his sandal".

    The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of
    Abraham. Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob
    the father of Judah and his brothers, Judah was the father of Perez and
    Zerah, Tamar being their mother, Perez was the father of Hezron, Hezron the
    father of Ram, Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of
    Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon, Salmon was the father of Boaz, Rahab
    being his mother, Boaz was the father of Obed, Ruth being his mother, Obed
    was the father of Jesse; and Jesse was the father of King David. David was
    the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife, Solomon was the
    father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,
    Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, Joram
    the father of Azariah, Azariah was the father of Jotham, Jotham the father
    of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh,
    Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah; and Josiah was the
    father of Jechoniah and his brothers. Then the deportation to Babylon took
    place. After the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah was the father of
    Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, Zerubbabel was the father of
    Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor, Azor was the
    father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, Achim the father of Eliud, Eliud
    was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father
    of Jacob; and Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary; of her was
    born Jesus who is called Christ. The sum of generations is therefore:
    fourteen from Abraham to David; fourteen from David to the Babylonian
    deportation; and fourteen from the Babylonian deportation to Christ. This is
    how Jesus Christ came to be born. His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph;
    but before they came to live together she was found to be with child through
    the Holy Spirit. Her husband Joseph; being a man of honour and wanting to
    spare her publicity, decided to divorce her informally. He had made up his
    mind to do this when the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and
    said, 'Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife,
    because she has conceived what is in her by the Holy Spirit. She will give
    birth to a son and you must name him Jesus, because he is the one who is to
    save his people from their sins.' Now all this took place to fulfil the
    words spoken by the Lord through the prophet: 'The virgin will conceive and
    give birth to a son and they will call him Emmanuel, a name which means
    'God-is-with-us'. When Joseph woke up he did what the angel of the Lord had
    told him to do: he took his wife to his home and, though he had not had
    intercourse with her, she gave birth to a son; and he named him Jesus.

    Now at this time Caesar Augustus issued a decree for a census of the whole
    world to be taken. This census - the first - took place while Quirinius was
    governor of Syria, and everyone went to his own town to be registered. So
    Joseph set out from the town of Nazareth in Galilee and travelled up to
    Judaea, to the town of David called Bethlehem, since he was of David's House
    and line, in order to be registered together with Mary, his betrothed, who
    was with child. While they were there the time came for her have her child,
    and she birth to a son, her first born. She wrapped him in swaddling
    clothes, and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them at the
    inn. In the countryside close by there were shepherds who lived in the
    fields and took it in turns to watch their flocks during the night. The
    angel of the Lord appeared to them and the glory of the Lord shone round
    them. They were terrified, but the angel said, 'Do not be afraid. Listen, I
    bring you news of great joy, a joy to be shared by the whole people. Today
    in the town of David a saviour has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.
    And here is a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling
    clothes and lying in a manger.' And suddenly with the angel there was a
    great throng of the heavenly host, praising God and singing: 'Glory to God
    in the highest heaven, and peace to men who enjoy his favour'

    At various times in the past and in various different ways, God spoke to our
    ancestors through the prophets; but in our own time, the last days, he has
    spoken to us through his Son, the Son that he has appointed to inherit
    everything and through whom he made everything there is. He is the radiant
    light of God's glory and the perfect copy of his nature, sustaining the
    universe by his powerful command; and now that he has destroyed the
    defilement of sin, he has gone to take his place in heaven at the right hand
    of divine Majesty. So he is now as far above the angels as the title which
    he has inherited is higher than their own name. God has never said to any
    angel: You are my Son, today I have become your father; will be a father to
    him and he a son to me. Again, when he brings the First-born into the world,
    he says: Let all the angels of God worship him.

    In the beginning was the Word: and the Word was with God and the Word was
    God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things came to be,
    not one thing had its being but through him. All that came to be had life in
    him and that life was the light of men, a light that shines in the dark, a
    light that darkness could not overpower. A man came, sent by God. His name
    was John. He came as a witness, as a witness to speak for the light, so that
    everyone might believe through him. He was not the light, only a witness to
    speak for the light. The Word was the true light that enlightens all men;
    and he was coming into the world. He was in the world that had its being
    through him, and the world did not know him. He came to his own domain and
    his own people did not accept him. But to all who did accept him he gave
    power to become children of God, to all who believe in the name of him who
    was born not out of human stock or urge of the flesh or will of man but of
    God himself. The Word was made flesh, he lived among us, and we saw his
    glory, the glory that is his as the only Son of the Father, full of grace
    and truth. John appears as his witness. He proclaims: 'This is the one of
    whom I said: He who comes after me ranks before me because he existed before
    me'. Indeed, from his fullness we have, all of us, received - yes, grace in
    return for grace, since, though the Law was given through Moses, grace and
    truth have come through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; it is the
    only Son, who is nearest to the Father's heart, who has made him known.

    After the wise men had left, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a
    dream and said, 'Get up, take the child and his mother with you, and escape
    into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search
    for the child and do away with him'. So Joseph got up and, taking the child
    and his mother with him, left that night for Egypt, where he stayed until
    Herod was dead. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the
    prophet: I called my son out of Egypt. After Herod's death, the angel of the
    Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, 'Get up, take the

    who wanted to kill the child are dead'. So Joseph got up and, taking the
    child and his mother with him, went back to the land of Israel. But when he
    learnt that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as ruler of Judaea he
    was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he left for the region
    of Galilee. There he settled in a town called Nazareth. In this way the
    words spoken through the prophets were to be fulfilled: 'He will be called a

    The word of the Lord was spoken to Abram in a vision, 'Have no fear, Abram,
    I am your shield, your reward will be very great'. 'My Lord,' Abram replied
    'what do you intend to give me? I go childless...' Then Abram said, 'See,
    you have given me no descendants; some man of my household will be my heir'.
    And then this word of the Lord was spoken to him, 'He shall not be your
    heir; your heir shall be of your own flesh and blood'. Then taking him
    outside he said, 'Look up to heaven and count the stars if you can. Such
    will be your descendants' he told him. Abram put his faith in the Lord, who
    counted this as making him justified. The Lord dealt kindly with Sarah as he
    had said, and did what he had promised her. So Sarah conceived and bore a
    son to Abraham in his old age, at the time God had promised. Abraham named
    the son born to him Isaac, the son to whom Sarah had given birth.

    It was by faith that Abraham obeyed the call to set out for a country that
    was the inheritance given to him and his descendants, and that he set out
    without knowing where he was going. It was equally by faith that Sarah, in
    spite of being past the age, was made able to conceive, because she believed
    that he who had made the promise would be faithful to it. Because of this,
    there came from one man, and one who was already as good as dead himself,
    more descendants than could be counted, as many as the stars of heaven or
    the grains of sand on the seashore. It was by faith that Abraham, when put
    to the test, offered up Isaac. He offered to sacrifice his only son even
    though the promises had been made to him and he had been told: It is through
    Isaac that your name will be carried on. He was confident that God had the
    power even to raise the dead; and so, figuratively speaking, he was given

    When the day came for them to be purified as laid down by the Law of Moses,
    the parents of Jesus took him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord-
    observing what stands written in the Law of the Lord: Every first-born male
    must be consecrated to the Lord- and also to offer in sacrifice, in
    accordance with what is said in the Law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves
    or two young pigeons. Now in Jerusalem there was a man named Simeon. He was
    an upright and devout man; he looked forward to Israel 's comforting and the
    Holy Spirit rested on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit
    that he would not see death until he had set eyes on the Christ of the Lord
    Prompted by the Spirit he came to the Temple and when the parents brought in
    the child Jesus to do for him what the Law required, he took him into his
    arms and blessed God; and he said: 'Now, Master, you can let your servant go
    in peace, just as you promised; because my eyes have seen the salvation
    which you have prepared for all the nations to see, a light to enlighten the
    pagans and the glory of your people Israel'. As the child's father and
    mother stood there wondering at the things that were being said about him,
    Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, 'You see this child: he is
    destined for the fall and for the rising of many in Israel, destined to be a
    sign that is rejected- and a sword will pierce your own soul too-so that the
    secret thoughts of many may be laid bare'. There was a prophetess also, Anna
    the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was well on in years.
    Her days of girlhood over, she had been married for seven years before
    becoming a widow. She was now eighty-four years old and never left the
    Temple, serving God night and day with fasting and prayer. She came by just
    at that moment and began to praise God; and she spoke of the child to all
    who looked forward to the deliverance of Jerusalem. When they had done
    everything the Law of the Lord required, they went back to Galilee, to their
    own town of Nazareth. Meanwhile the child grew to maturity, and he was
    filled with wisdom; and God's favour was with him.

    Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son, and called him Samuel 'since' she
    said 'I asked the Lord for him.' When a year had gone by, the husband
    Elkanah went up again with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to
    the Lord and to fulfil his vow. Hannah, however, did not go up, having said
    to her husband, 'Not before the child is weaned. Then I will bring him and
    present him before the Lord and he shall stay there for ever.' When she had
    weaned him, she took him up with her together with a three-year old bull, an
    ephah of flour and a skin of wine, and she brought him to the temple of the
    Lord at Shiloh; and the child was with them. They slaughtered the bull and
    the child's mother came to Eli. She said, 'If you please, my lord. As you
    live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you, praying to the
    Lord. This is the child I prayed for, and the Lord granted me what I asked
    him. Now I make him over to the Lord for the whole of his life. He is made

    After the wise men had left, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a
    dream and said, 'Get up, take the child and his mother with you, and escape
    into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search
    for the child and do away with him'. So Joseph got up and, taking the child
    and his mother with him, left that night for Egypt, where he stayed until
    Herod was dead. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the
    prophet: I called my son out of Egypt. After Herod's death, the angel of the
    Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, 'Get up, take the
    child and his mother with you and go back to the land of Israel, for those
    who wanted to kill the child are dead'. So Joseph got up and, taking the
    child and his mother with him, went back to the land of Israel. But when he
    learnt that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as ruler of Judaea he
    was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he left for the region
    of Galilee. There he settled in a town called Nazareth. In this way the
    words spoken through the prophets were to be fulfilled: 'He will be called a
    Nazarene.'

    Every year the parents of Jesus used to go to Jerusalem for the feast of the
    Passover. When he was twelve years old, they went up for the feast as usual.
    When they were on their way home after the feast, the boy Jesus stayed
    behind in Jerusalem without his parents knowing it. They assumed he was with
    the caravan, and it was only after a day's journey that they went to look
    for him among their relations and acquaintances. When they failed to find
    him they went back to Jerusalem looking for him everywhere. Three days
    later, they found him in the Temple, sitting among the doctors, listening to
    them, and asking them questions; and all those who heard him were astounded
    at his intelligence and his replies. They were overcome when they saw him,
    and his mother said to him, 'My child, why have you done this to us? See how
    worried your father and I have been, looking for you.' 'Why were you looking
    for me?' he replied 'Did you not know that I must be busy with my Father's
    affairs?' But they did not understand what he meant. He then went down with
    them and came to Nazareth and lived under their authority. His mother stored
    up all these things in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom, in stature,
    and in favour with God and men.

    We can be sure that we know Jesus only by keeping his commandments. Anyone

    God's love comes to perfection in him. We can be sure that we are in God
    only when the one who claims to be living in him is living the same kind of
    life as Christ lived. My dear people, this is not a new commandment that I

    beginning, the original commandment which was the message brought to you.
    Yet in another way, what I am writing to you, and what is being carried out

    There was a prophetess also, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of
    Asher. She was well on in years. Her days of girlhood over, she had been
    married for seven years before becoming a widow. She was now eighty-four
    years old and never left the Temple, serving God night and day with fasting
    and prayer. She came by just at that moment and began to praise God; and she
    spoke of the child to all who looked forward to the deliverance of
    Jerusalem. When they had done everything the Law of the Lord required, they
    went back to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. Meanwhile the child
    grew to maturity, and he was filled with wisdom; and God's favour was with
    him.

    Children, these are the last days; you were told that an Antichrist must
    come, and now several antichrists have already appeared; we know from this
    that these are the last days. Those rivals of Christ came out of our own
    number, but they had never really belonged; if they had belonged, they would
    have stayed with us; but they left us, to prove that not one of them ever
    belonged to us. But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and have all
    received the knowledge. It is not because you do not know the truth that I
    am writing to you but rather because you know it already and know that no
    lie can come from the truth.

    In the beginning was the Word: and the Word was with God and the Word was
    God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things came to be,
    not one thing had its being but through him. All that came to be had life in
    him and that life was the light of men, a light that shines in the dark, a
    light that darkness could not overpower. A man came, sent by God. His name
    was John. He came as a witness, as a witness to speak for the light, so that
    everyone might believe through him. He was not the light, only a witness to
    speak for the light. The Word was the true light that enlightens all men;
    and he was coming into the world. He was in the world that had its being
    through him, and the world did not know him. He came to his own domain and
    his own people did not accept him. But to all who did accept him he gave
    power to become children of God, to all who believe in the name of him who
    was born not out of human stock or urge of the flesh or will of man but of
    God himself. The Word was made flesh, he lived among us, and we saw his
    glory, the glory that is his as the only Son of the Father, full of grace
    and truth. John appears as his witness. He proclaims: 'This is the one of
    whom I said: He who comes after me ranks before me because he existed before
    me'. Indeed, from his fulness we have, all of us, received - yes, grace in
    return for grace, since, though the Law was given through Moses, grace and
    truth have come through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; it is the
    only Son, who is nearest to the Father's heart, who has made him known.
