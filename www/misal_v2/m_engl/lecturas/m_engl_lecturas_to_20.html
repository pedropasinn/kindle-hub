    Let me tell you pagans this: I have been sent to the pagans as their

    my own people envious of you, and in this way save some of them.&nbsp;Since
    their rejection meant the reconciliation of the world, do you know what
    their admission will mean? Nothing less than a resurrection from the
    dead!&nbsp;Just as you changed from being disobedient to God, and now enjoy
    mercy because of their disobedience,&nbsp;so those who are disobedient now -

    Jesus left Gennesaret and withdrew to the region of Tyre and
    Sidon.&nbsp;Then out came a Canaanite woman from that district and started
    shouting, 'Sir, Son of David, take pity on me. My daughter is tormented by a
    devil.'&nbsp;But he answered her not a word. And his disciples went and
    pleaded with him. 'Give her what she wants,' they said 'because she is
    shouting after us.'&nbsp;He said in reply, 'I was sent only to the lost
    sheep of the House of Israel'.&nbsp;But the woman had come up and was
    kneeling at his feet. 'Lord,' she said 'help me.'&nbsp;He replied, 'It is
    not fair to take the children's food and throw it to the
    house-dogs'.&nbsp;She retorted, 'Ah yes, sir; but even house-dogs can eat
    the scraps that fall from their master's table'.&nbsp;Then Jesus answered
    her, 'Woman, you have great faith. Let your wish be granted.' And from that
    moment her daughter was well again.

    Jesus said to the crowd: I am the living bread which has come down from
    heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will live for ever; and the bread that I
    shall give is my flesh, for the life of the world.'&nbsp;Then the Jews
    started arguing with one another: 'How can this man give us his flesh to
    eat?' they said.&nbsp;Jesus replied: I tell you most solemnly, if you do not
    eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life
    in you.&nbsp;Anyone who does eat my flesh and drink my blood has eternal
    life, and I shall raise him up on the last day.&nbsp;For my flesh is real
    food and my blood is real drink.&nbsp;He who eats my flesh and drinks my

    the welfare of this people at heart so much as its ruin.'&nbsp;'He is in

    There was no water in the well, only mud, and into the mud Jeremiah

    The sons of Israel did what displeases the Lord and served the
    Baals.&nbsp;They deserted the Lord, the God of their ancestors, who had
    brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods from the gods
    of the peoples round them. They bowed down to these; they provoked the
    Lord;&nbsp;they deserted the Lord to serve Baal and Astarte.&nbsp;Then the
    Lord's anger flamed out against Israel. He handed them over to pillagers who
    plundered them; he delivered them to the enemies surrounding them, and they
    were not able to resist them.&nbsp;In every warlike venture, the hand of the
    Lord was there to foil them, as the Lord had warned, as the Lord had sworn
    to them. Thus he reduced them to dire distress.&nbsp;Then the Lord appointed
    judges for them, and rescued the men of Israel from the hands of their
    plunderers.&nbsp;But they would not listen to their judges. They prostituted
    themselves to other gods, and bowed down before these. Very quickly they
    left the path their ancestors had trodden in obedience to the orders of the
    Lord; they did not follow their example.&nbsp;When the Lord appointed judges
    for them, the Lord was with the judge and rescued them from the hands of
    their enemies as long as the judge lived, for the Lord felt pity for them as
    they groaned under the iron grip of their oppressors.&nbsp;But once the
    judge was dead, they relapsed and behaved even worse than their ancestors.
    They followed other gods; they served them and bowed before them, and would
    not give up the practices and stubborn ways of their ancestors at all.

    There was a man who came to Jesus and asked, 'Master, what good deed must I
    do to possess eternal life?' Jesus said to him, 'Why do you ask me about
    what is good? There is one alone who is good. But if you wish to enter into
    life, keep the commandments.' He said, 'Which?' 'These:' Jesus replied 'You
    must not kill. You must not commit adultery. You must not bring false
    witness. Honour your father and mother, and: you must love your neighbour as
    yourself' The young man said to him, 'I have kept all these. What more do I
    need to do?' Jesus said, 'If you wish to be perfect, go and sell what you
    own and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven;
    then come, follow me'. But when the young man heard these words he went away
    sad, for he was a man of great wealth.

    The angel of the Lord came and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah which
    belonged to Joash of Abiezer. Gideon his son was threshing wheat inside the
    winepress to keep it hidden from Midian,&nbsp;when the angel of the Lord
    appeared to him and said, 'The Lord is with you, valiant
    warrior!'&nbsp;Gideon answered him,&nbsp; 'Forgive me, my lord, but if the
    Lord is with us, then why is it that all this is happening to us now? And
    where are all the wonders our ancestors tell us of when they say, "Did not
    the Lord bring us out of Egypt?" But now the Lord has deserted us; he has
    abandoned us to Midian.'&nbsp;At this the Lord turned to him and said, 'Go
    in the strength now upholding you, and you will rescue Israel from the power
    of Midian. Do I not send you myself?'&nbsp;Gideon answered him, 'Forgive me,
    my lord, but how can I deliver Israel? My clan, you must know, is the
    weakest in Manasseh and I am the least important in my family.'&nbsp;The
    Lord answered him, 'I will be with you and you shall crush Midian as though
    it were a single man'.&nbsp;Gideon said to him, 'If I have found favour in
    your sight, give me a sign that it is you who speak to me.&nbsp;I beg you,
    do not go away until I come back, I will bring you my&nbsp; offering and set
    it down before you.' And he answered, 'I will stay until you
    return'.&nbsp;Gideon went away and prepared a young goat and made unleavened
    cakes with an ephah of flour. He put the meat into a basket and the broth
    into a pot, then brought it all to him under the terebinth. As he came near,
    &nbsp;The angel of the Lord said to him, 'Take the meat and unleavened
    cakes, put them on this rock and pour the broth over them'. Gideon did
    so.&nbsp;Then the angel of the Lord reached out the tip of the staff in his
    hand and touched the meat and unleavened cakes. Fire sprang from the rock
    and consumed the meat and unleavened cakes, and the angel of the Lord
    vanished before his eyes.&nbsp;Then Gideon knew this was the angel of the
    Lord, and he said, 'Alas, my Lord! I have seen the angel of the Lord face to
    face!'&nbsp;The Lord answered him, 'Peace be with you; have no fear; you
    will not die'. &nbsp;Gideon built an altar there to the Lord and called it
    The-Lord-is-Peace.

    Jesus said to his disciples, 'I tell you solemnly, it will be hard for a

    easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man
    to enter the kingdom of heaven.'&nbsp;When the disciples heard this they
    were astonished. 'Who can be saved, then?' they said.&nbsp;Jesus gazed at
    them. 'For men' he told them 'this is impossible; for God everything is
    possible.'&nbsp;Then Peter spoke. 'What about us?' he said to him 'We have
    left everything and followed you. What are we to have, then?'&nbsp;Jesus
    said to him, 'I tell you solemnly, when all is made new and the Son of Man
    sits on his throne of glory, you will yourselves sit on twelve thrones to
    judge the twelve tribes of Israel.&nbsp;And everyone who has left houses,

    themselves! Shepherds ought to feed their flock,&nbsp;yet you have fed on
    milk, you have dressed yourselves in wool, you have sacrificed the fattest
    sheep, but failed to feed the flock.&nbsp;You have failed to make weak sheep
    strong, or to care for the sick ones, or bandage the wounded ones. You have
    failed to bring back strays or look for the lost. On the contrary, you have
    ruled them cruelly and violently.&nbsp;For lack of a shepherd they have
    scattered, to become the prey of any wild animal; they have scattered
    far.&nbsp;My flock is straying this way and that, on mountains and on high
    hills; my flock has been scattered all over the country; no one bothers
    about them and no one looks for them.&nbsp;Well then, shepherds, hear the
    word of the Lord.&nbsp;As I live, I swear it - it is the Lord who speaks -
    since my flock has been looted and for lack of a shepherd is now the prey of
    any wild animal, since my shepherds have stopped bothering about my flock,

    this, shepherds, hear the word of the Lord.&nbsp;The Lord says this: I am
    going to call the shepherds to account. I am going to take my flock back
    from them and I shall not allow them to feed my flock. In this way the
    shepherds will stop feeding themselves. I shall rescue my sheep from their
    mouths; they will not prey on them any more.&nbsp;For the Lord says this: I

    Jesus told this parable to his disciples: 'The kingdom of heaven is like a
    landowner going out at daybreak to hire workers for his vineyard.&nbsp;He
    made an agreement with the workers for one denarius a day, and sent them to
    his vineyard.&nbsp;Going out at about the third hour he saw others standing
    idle in the market place &nbsp;and said to them, "You go to my vineyard too
    and I will give you a fair wage".&nbsp;So they went. At about the sixth hour
    and again at about the ninth hour, he went out and did the same.&nbsp;Then
    at about the eleventh hour he went out and found more men standing round,
    and he said to them, "Why have you been standing here idle all
    day?"&nbsp;"Because no one has hired us" they answered. He said to them,
    "You go into my vineyard too".&nbsp;In the evening, the owner of the
    vineyard said to his bailiff, "Call the workers and pay them their wages,
    starting with the last arrivals and ending with the first".&nbsp;So those
    who were hired at about the eleventh hour came forward and received one
    denarius each.&nbsp;When the first came, they expected to get more, but they
    too received one denarius each.&nbsp;They took it, but grumbled at the
    landowner.&nbsp;"The men who came last" they said "have done only one hour,
    and you have treated them the same as us, though we have done a heavy day's
    work in all the heat."&nbsp;He answered one of them and said, "My friend, I
    am not being unjust to you; did we not agree on one denarius?&nbsp;Take your
    earnings and go. I choose to pay the last comer as much as I pay
    you.&nbsp;Have I no right to do what I like with my own? Why be envious
    because I am generous?"&nbsp;Thus the last will be first, and the first,
    last.'

  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    The spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah, who crossed Gilead and Manasseh,
    passed through to Mizpah in Gilead, and from Mizpah in Gilead made his way
    to the rear of the Ammonites.&nbsp;And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord, 'If
    you deliver the Ammonites into my hands,&nbsp;then the first person to meet
    me from the door of my house when I return in triumph from fighting the
    Ammonites shall belong to the Lord, and I will offer him up as a
    holocaust'.&nbsp;Jephthah marched against the Ammonites to attack them, and
    the Lord delivered them&nbsp; into his power.&nbsp;He harassed them from
    Aroer almost to Minnith (twenty towns) and to Abel-keramim. It was a very
    severe defeat, and the Ammonites were humbled before the Israelites.&nbsp;As
    Jephthah returned to his house at Mizpah, his daughter came out from it to
    meet him; she was dancing to the sound of timbrels. This was his only child;
    apart from her he had neither son nor daughter.&nbsp;When he saw her, he
    tore his clothes and exclaimed, 'Oh my daughter, what sorrow you are
    bringing me! Must it be you, the cause of my ill-fortune!&nbsp; I have given
    a promise to the Lord, and I cannot unsay what I have said.'&nbsp;She
    answered him, 'My father, you have given a promise to the Lord; treat me as
    the vow you took binds you to, since the Lord has given you vengeance on
    your enemies the Ammonites.'&nbsp;Then she said to her father, 'Grant me one
    request. Let me be free for two months. I shall go and wander in the
    mountains, and with my companions bewail my virginity.'&nbsp;He answered,
    'Go', and let her depart for two months. So she went away with her
    companions and bewailed her virginity in the mountains.&nbsp;When the two
    months were over, she returned to her father, and he treated her as the vow
    that he had uttered bound him.

    Jesus began to speak to them in parables once again,&nbsp;'The kingdom of
    heaven may be compared to a king who gave a feast for his son's
    wedding.&nbsp;He sent his servants to call those who had been invited, but
    they would not come.&nbsp;Next he sent some more servants. "Tell those who
    have been invited" he said "that I have my banquet all prepared, my oxen and
    fattened cattle have been slaughtered, everything is ready. Come to the
    wedding."&nbsp;But they were not interested: one went off to his farm,
    another to his business,&nbsp;and the rest seized his servants, maltreated
    them and killed them.&nbsp;The king was furious. He despatched his troops,
    destroyed those murderers and burnt their town.&nbsp;Then he said to his
    servants, "The wedding is ready; but as those who were invited proved to be
    unworthy,&nbsp;go to the crossroads in the town and invite everyone you can
    find to the wedding". &nbsp;So these servants went out on to the roads and
    collected together everyone they could find, bad and good alike; and the
    wedding hall was filled with guests.&nbsp;When the king came in to look at
    the guests he noticed one man who was not wearing a wedding
    garment,&nbsp;and said to him, "How did you get in here, my friend, without
    a wedding garment?" And the man was silent.&nbsp;Then the king said to the
    attendants, "Bind him hand and foot and throw him out into the dark, where
    there will be weeping and grinding of teeth".&nbsp;For many are called, but
    few are chosen.'

    In the days of the Judges famine came to the land and a certain man from
    Bethlehem of Judah went - he, his wife and his two sons - to live in the
    country of Moab.&nbsp;Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she and her two
    sons were left.&nbsp;These married Moabite women: one was named Orpah and
    the other Ruth. They lived there about ten years.&nbsp;Then both Mahion and
    Chilion also died and the woman was bereft of her two sons and her
    husband.&nbsp;So she and her daughters-in-law prepared to return from the
    country of Moab, for she had heard that the Lord had visited his people and
    given them food.&nbsp;And once more they started to weep aloud. Then Orpah
    kissed her mother-in-law and went back to her people. But Ruth clung to
    her.&nbsp;Naomi said to her, 'Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her
    people and to her god. You must return too; follow your
    sister-in-law.'&nbsp;But Ruth said, 'Do not press me to leave you and to
    turn back from your company, for 'wherever you go, I will go, wherever you
    live, I will live. Your people shall be my people, and your God, my
    God.&nbsp;This was how Naomi, she who returned from the country of Moab,
    came back with Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law. And they came to
    Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.

    37:1&nbsp;The hand of the Lord was laid on me, and he carried me away by the
    spirit of the Lord and set me down in the middle of a valley, a valley full
    of bones. 37:2&nbsp;He made me walk up and down among them. There were vast
    quantities of these bones on the ground the whole length of the valley; and
    they were quite dried up. 37:3&nbsp;He said to me, 'Son of man, can these
    bones live?' I said, 'You know, Lord '. 37:4&nbsp;He said, 'Prophesy over
    these bones. Say, "Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. The Lord says this
    to these bones: I am now going to make the breath enter you, and you will
    live. 37:6&nbsp;I shall put sinews on you, I shall make flesh grow on you, I
    shall cover you with skin and give you breath, and you will live; and you
    will learn that I am the Lord."' 37:7&nbsp;I prophesied as I had been
    ordered. While I was prophesying, there was a noise, a sound of clattering;
    and the bones joined together. 37:8&nbsp;I looked, and saw that they were
    covered with sinews; flesh was growing on them and skin was covering them,
    but there was no breath in them. 37:9&nbsp;He said to me, 'Prophesy to the
    breath; prophesy, son of man. Say to the breath, "The Lord says this: Come
    from the four winds, breath; breathe on these dead; let them live!"'
    37:10&nbsp;I prophesied as he had ordered me, and the breath entered them;
    they came to life again and stood up on their feet, a great, an immense
    army. 37:11&nbsp;Then he said, 'Son of man, these bones are the whole House
    of Israel. They keep saying, "Our bones are dried up, our hope has gone; we
    are as good as dead". 37:12&nbsp;So prophesy. Say to them, "The Lord says
    this: I am now going to open your graves; I mean to raise you from your
    graves, my people, and lead you back to the soil of Israel. 37:13&nbsp;And
    you will know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves and raise you from
    your graves, my people. 37:14&nbsp;And I shall put my spirit in you, and you
    will live, and I shall resettle you on your own soil; and you will know that
    I, the Lord, have said and done this - it is the Lord who speaks."

  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    Naomi had a kinsman on her husband's side, well-to-do and of Elimelech's
    clan. His name was Boaz. &nbsp;Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, 'Let me go
    into the fields and glean among the ears of corn in the footsteps of some
    man who will look on me with favour'. And she said to her, 'Go, my
    daughter'.&nbsp;So she set out and went to glean in the fields after the
    reapers. And it chanced that she came to that part of the fields which
    belonged to Boaz of Elimelech's clan. &nbsp;Boaz said to Ruth, 'Listen, my
    daughter, and understand this. You are not to glean in any other field, do
    not leave here but stay with my servants. &nbsp;Keep your eyes on whatever
    part of the field they are reaping and follow behind. I have ordered my
    servants not to molest you. And if you are thirsty, go to the pitchers and
    drink what the servants have drawn.' &nbsp;Then she fell on her face, bowing
    to the ground. And she said to him, 'How have I so earned your favour that
    you take notice of me, even though I am a foreigner?' &nbsp;And Boaz
    answered her, 'I have been told all you have done for your mother-in-law
    since your husband's death, and how you left your own father and mother and
    the land where you were born to come among a people whom you knew nothing
    about before you came here. &nbsp;So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife.
    And when they came together, the Lord made her conceive and she bore a son.
    &nbsp;And the women said to Naomi, 'Blessed be the Lord who has not left the
    dead man without next of kin this day to perpetuate his name in Israel.
    &nbsp;The child will be a comfort to you and the prop of your old age, for
    your daughter-in-law who loves you and is more to you than seven sons has
    given him birth.' &nbsp;And Naomi took the child to her own bosom and she
    became his nurse. &nbsp;And the women of the neighbourhood gave him a name.
    'A son has been born for Naomi' they said; and they named him Obed. This was
    the father of David's father, Jesse.

    The angel took me to the gate, the one facing east. &nbsp;I saw the glory of
    the God of Israel approaching from the east. A sound came with it, like the
    sound of the ocean, and the earth shone with his glory. &nbsp;This vision
    was like the one I had seen when I had come for the destruction of the city,
    and like the one I had seen on the bank of the river Chebar. Then I
    prostrated myself. &nbsp;The glory of the Lord arrived at the Temple by the
    east gate. &nbsp;The spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner
    court; I saw the glory of the Lord fill the Temple. &nbsp;And I heard
    someone speaking to me from the Temple while the man stood beside me.
    &nbsp;The voice said, 'Son of man, this is the dais of my throne, the step
    on which I rest my feet. I shall live here among the sons of Israel for
    ever.

    Addressing the people and his disciples Jesus said, &nbsp;'The scribes and
    the Pharisees occupy the chair of Moses. &nbsp;You must therefore do what
    they tell you and listen to what they say; but do not be guided by what they
    do: since they do not practise what they preach. &nbsp;They tie up heavy
    burdens and lay them on men's shoulders, but will they lift a finger to move
    them? Not they! &nbsp;Everything they do is done to attract attention, like
    wearing broader phylacteries and longer tassels, &nbsp;like wanting to take
    the place of honour at banquets and the front seats in the synagogues,
    &nbsp;being greeted obsequiously in the market squares and having people
    call them Rabbi. &nbsp;'You, however, must not allow yourselves to be called
    Rabbi, since you have only one master, and you are all brothers. &nbsp;You
    must call no one on earth your father, since you have only one Father, and
    he is in heaven. &nbsp;Nor must you allow yourselves to be called teachers,
    for you have only one Teacher, the Christ. &nbsp;The greatest among you must
    be your servant. &nbsp;Anyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and anyone
    who humbles himself will exalted.
