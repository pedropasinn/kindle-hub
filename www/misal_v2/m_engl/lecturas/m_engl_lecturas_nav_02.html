    The shepherds hurried away to Bethlehem and found Mary and Joseph, and the
    baby lying in the manger. When they saw the child they repeated what they
    had been told about him, and everyone who heard it was astonished at what
    the shepherds had to say. As for Mary, she treasured all these things and
    pondered them in her heart. And the shepherds went back glorifying and
    praising God for all they had heard and seen; it was exactly as they had
    been told. When the eighth day came and the child was to be circumcised,
    they gave him the name Jesus, the name the angel had given him before his

    In the beginning was the Word: and the Word was with God and the Word was
    God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things came to be,
    not one thing had its being but through him. All that came to be had life in
    him and that life was the light of men, a light that shines in the dark, a
    light that darkness could not overpower. A man came, sent by God. His name
    was John. He came as a witness, as a witness to speak for the light, so that
    everyone might believe through him. He was not the light, only a witness to
    speak for the light. The Word was the true light that enlightens all men;
    and he was coming into the world. He was in the world that had its being
    through him, and the world did not know him. He came to his own domain and
    his own people did not accept him. But to all who did accept him he gave
    power to become children of God, to all who believe in the name of him who
    was born not out of human stock or urge of the flesh or will of man but of
    God himself. The Word was made flesh, he lived among us, and we saw his
    glory, the glory that is his as the only Son of the Father, full of grace
    and truth. John appears as his witness. He proclaims: 'This is the one of
    whom I said: He who comes after me ranks before me because he existed before
    me'. Indeed, from his fullness we have, all of us, received - yes, grace in
    return for grace, since, though the Law was given through Moses, grace and
    truth have come through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; it is the
    only Son, who is nearest to the Father's heart, who has made him known.

    The man who denies that Jesus is the Christ-he is the liar, he is

    his own promise is eternal life. This is all that I am writing to you about

    anointing that he gave you, and you do not need anyone to teach you; the

    This is how John appeared as a witness. When the Jews sent priests and
    Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, 'Who are you?' he not only declared, but
    he declared quite openly, 'I am not the Christ'. 'Well then,' they asked
    'are you Elijah?' 'I am not' he said. 'Are you the Prophet?' He answered,
    'No'. So they said to him, 'Who are you? We must take back an answer to
    those who sent us. What have you to say about yourself?' So John said, 'I
    am, as Isaiah prophesied: a voice that cries in the wilderness: Make a
    straight way for the Lord'. Now these men had been sent by the Pharisees,
    and they put this further question to him, 'Why are you baptising if you are
    not the Christ, and not Elijah, and not the prophet?' John replied, 'I
    baptise with water; but there stands among you - unknown to you - the one
    who is coming after me; and I am not fit to undo his sandal-strap'. This
    happened at Bethany, on the far side of the Jordan, where John was
    baptising.

    You know that God is righteous - then you must recognise that everyone whose
    life is righteous has been begotten by him. Think of the love that the
    Father has lavished on us, by letting us be called God's children; and that
    is what we are. Because the world refused to acknowledge him, therefore it
    does not acknowledge us. My dear people, we are already the children of God
    but what we are to be in the future has not yet been revealed; all we know
    is, that when it is revealed we shall be like him because we shall see him
    as he really is. Surely everyone who entertains this hope must purify
    himself, must try to be as pure as Christ. Anyone who sins at all breaks the
    law, because to sin is to break the law. Now you know that he appeared in

    Seeing Jesus coming towards him, John said, 'Look, there is the lamb of God
    that takes away the sin of the world. &nbsp;This is the one I spoke of when
    I said: A man is coming after me who ranks before me because he existed
    before me. I did not know him myself, and yet it was to reveal him to Israel
    that I came baptising with water.' John also declared, 'I saw the Spirit
    coming down on him from heaven like a dove and resting on him. I did not
    know him myself, but he who sent me to baptise with water had said to me,
    "The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and rest is the one who is

    My children, do not let anyone lead you astray: to live a holy life is to be
    holy just as God is holy; to lead a sinful life is to belong to the devil,
    since the devil was a sinner from the beginning. It was to undo all that the
    devil has done that the Son of God appeared. No one who has been begotten by
    God sins; because God's seed remains inside him, he cannot sin when he has
    been begotten by God. In this way we distinguish the children of God from
    the children of the devil: anybody not living a holy life and not loving his
    brother is no child of God's.

    As John stood there with two of his disciples, Jesus passed, and John stared
    hard at him and said, 'Look, there is the lamb of God'. Hearing this, the
    two disciples followed Jesus. Jesus turned round, saw them following and
    said, 'What do you want?' They answered, 'Rabbi,' - which means Teacher
    -'where do you live?' 'Come and see' he replied; so they went and saw where
    he lived, and stayed with him the rest of that day. It was about the tenth
    hour. One of these two who became followers of Jesus after hearing what John
    had said was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter. Early next morning, Andrew
    met his brother and said to him, 'We have found the Messiah' - which means
    the Christ and he took Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked hard at him and said,
    'You are Simon son of John; you are to be called Cephas' - meaning Rock.

    This is the message as you heard it from the beginning: that we are to love
    one another; not to be like Cain, who belonged to the Evil One and cut his
    brother's throat; cut his brother's throat simply for this reason, that his
    own life was evil and his brother lived a good life. You must not be
    surprised, brothers, when the world hates you; we have passed out of death
    and into life, and of this we can be sure because we love our brothers. If
    you refuse to love, you must remain dead; to hate your brother is to be a
    murderer, and murderers, as you know, do not have eternal life in them. This
    has taught us love - that he gave up his life for us; and we, too, ought to
    give up our lives for our brothers. If a man who was rich enough in this
    world's goods saw that one of his brothers was in need, but closed his heart
    to him, how could the love of God be living in him? My children, our love is
    not to be just words or mere talk, but something real and active; only by
    this can we be certain that we are children of the truth and be able to
    quieten our conscience in his presence, whatever accusations it may raise
    against us, because God is greater than our conscience and he knows
    everything. My dear people, if we cannot be condemned by our own conscience,
    we need not be afraid in God's presence.

    After Jesus had decided to leave for Galilee, he met Philip and said,
    'Follow me'. Philip came from the same town, Bethsaida, as Andrew and Peter.
    Philip found Nathanael and said to him, 'We have found the one Moses wrote
    about in the Law, the one about whom the prophets wrote: he is Jesus son of
    Joseph, from Nazareth '. 'From Nazareth ?' said Nathanael 'Can anything good
    come from that place?' 'Come and see' replied Philip. When Jesus saw
    Nathanael coming he said of him, 'There is an Israelite who deserves the
    name, incapable of deceit'. 'How do you know me?' said Nathanael 'Before
    Philip came to call you,' said Jesus 'I saw you under the fig tree.'
    Nathanael answered, 'Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are the King of
    Israel'. Jesus replied, 'You believe that just because I said: I saw you
    under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that.' And then he
    added 'I tell you most solemnly, you will see heaven laid open and, above
    the Son of Man, the angels of God ascending and descending'.

    After Jesus had been born at Bethlehem in Judaea during the reign of King
    Herod, some wise men came to Jerusalem from the east. 'Where is the infant
    king of the Jews?' they asked. 'We saw his star as it rose and have come to
    do him homage.' When King Herod heard this he was perturbed, and so was the
    whole of Jerusalem. He called together all the chief priests and the scribes
    of the people, and enquired of them where the Christ was to be born. 'At
    Bethlehem in Judaea,' they told him 'for this is what the prophet wrote: And
    you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, you are by no means least among the
    leaders of Judah, for out of you will come a leader who will shepherd my
    people Israel'. Then Herod summoned the wise men to see him privately. He
    asked them the exact date on which the star had appeared, and sent them on
    to Bethlehem. 'Go and find out all about the child,' he said 'and when you
    have found him, let me know, so that I too may go and do him homage.' Having
    listened to what the king had to say, they set out. And there in front of
    them was the star they had seen rising; it went forward, and halted over the
    place where the child was. The sight of the star filled them with delight,
    and going into the house they saw the child with his mother Mary, and
    falling to their knees they did him homage. Then, opening their treasures,
    they offered him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh. But they were
    warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, and returned to their own country
    by a different way.

    with water and blood; with the Spirit as another witness-since the Spirit is

    In the course of his preaching John the Baptist said, 'Someone is following
    me, someone who is more powerful than I am, and I am not fit to kneel down
    and undo the strap of his sandals. I have baptised you with water, but he
    will baptise you with the Holy Spirit.' It was at this time that Jesus came
    from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptised in the Jordan by John. No sooner
    had he come up out of the water than he saw the heavens torn apart and the
    Spirit, like a dove, descending on him. And a voice came from heaven, 'You
