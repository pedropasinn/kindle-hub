    If our life in Christ means anything to you, if love can persuade at all, or
    the Spirit that we have in common, or any tenderness and sympathy,
    &nbsp;then be united in your convictions and united in your love, with a
    common purpose and a common mind. That is the one thing which would make me
    completely happy. &nbsp;There must be no competition among you, no conceit;
    but everybody is to be self-effacing. Always consider the other person to be
    better than yourself, &nbsp;So that nobody thinks of his own interests first
    but everybody thinks of other people's interests instead. &nbsp;In your
    minds you must be the same as Christ Jesus: &nbsp;His state was divine, yet
    he did not cling to his equality with God &nbsp;but emptied himself to
    assume the condition of a slave, and became as men are; and being as all men
    are, &nbsp;he was humbler yet, even to accepting death, death on a cross.
    &nbsp;But God raised him high and gave him the name which is above all other
    names &nbsp;so that all beings in the heavens, on earth and in the
    underworld, should bend the knee at the name of Jesus &nbsp;and that every
    tongue should acclaim Jesus Christ as Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

    The love of Christ overwhelms us when we reflect that if one man has died
    for all, then all men should be dead; and the reason he died for all was so
    that living men should live no longer for themselves, but for him who died
    and was raised to life for them. From now onwards, therefore, we do not
    judge anyone by the standards of the flesh. Even if we did once know Christ
    in the flesh, that is not how we know him now. And for anyone who is in
    Christ, there is a new creation; the old creation has gone, and now the new
    one is here. It is all God's work. It was God who reconciled us to himself
    through Christ and gave us the work of handing on this reconciliation. In
    other words, God in Christ was reconciling the world to himself, not holding
    men's faults against them, and he has entrusted to us the news that they are
    reconciled. So we are ambassadors for Christ; it is as though God were
    appealing through us, and the appeal that we make in Christ's name is: be
    reconciled to God.

    can only be thrown out to be trampled underfoot by men. 'You are the light

    for everyone in the house. In the same way your light must shine in the

    There was a man who came to Jesus and asked, 'Master, what good deed must I
    do to possess eternal life?' Jesus said to him, 'Why do you ask me about
    what is good? There is one alone who is good. But if you wish to enter into
    life, keep the commandments.' He said, 'Which?' 'These:' Jesus replied 'You
    must not kill. You must not commit adultery. You must not bring false
    witness. Honour your father and mother, and: you must love your neighbour as
    yourself' The young man said to him, 'I have kept all these. What more do I
    need to do?' Jesus said, 'If you wish to be perfect, go and sell what you
    own and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven;
    then come, follow me'. But when the young man heard these words he went away
    sad, for he was a man of great wealth. Then Jesus said to his disciples, 'I
    tell you solemnly, it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of
    heaven. Yes, I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to pass through the
    eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.' When
    the disciples heard this they were astonished. 'Who can be saved, then?'
    they said. Jesus gazed at them. 'For men' he told them 'this is impossible;
    for God everything is possible.'

    Take yourselves for instance, brothers, at the time when you were called:
    how many of you were wise in the ordinary sense of the word, how many were
    influential people, or came from noble families? No, it was to shame the
    wise that God chose what is foolish by human reckoning, and to shame what is
    strong that he chose what is weak by human reckoning; those whom the world
    thinks common and contemptible are the ones that God has chosen - those who
    are nothing at all to show up those who are everything. The human race has
    nothing to boast about to God, but you, God has made members of Christ Jesus
    and by God's doing he has become our wisdom, and our virtue, and our

    Paul said to the people, 'I am a Jew and was born at Tarsus in Cilicia. I
    was brought up here in this city. I studied under Gamaliel and was taught
    the exact observance of the Law of our ancestors. In fact, I was as full of
    duty towards God as you are today. I even persecuted this Way to the death,
    and sent women as well as men to prison in chains as the high priest and the
    whole council of elders can testify, since they even sent me with letters'
    to their brothers in Damascus. When I set off it was with the intention of
    bringing prisoners back from there to Jerusalem for punishment. 'I was on
    that journey and nearly at Damascus when about midday a bright light from
    heaven suddenly shone round me. I fell to the ground and heard a voice
    saying, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?" I answered: Who are you,
    Lord? and he said to me, "I am Jesus the Nazarene, and you are persecuting
    me". The people with me saw the light but did not hear his voice as he spoke
    to me. I said: What am I to do, Lord? The Lord answered, "Stand up and go
    into Damascus, and there you will be told what you have been appointed to
    do". The light had been so dazzling that I was blind and my companions had
    to take me by the hand; and so I came to Damascus. Someone called Ananias, a
    devout follower of the Law and highly thought of by all the Jews living
    there, came to see me; he stood beside me and said, "Brother Saul, receive
    your sight". Instantly my sight came back and I was able to see him. Then he
    said, "The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will, to see the
    Just One and hear his own voice speaking, because you are to be his witness
    before all mankind, testifying to what you have seen and heard. And now why
    delay? It is time you were baptised and had your sins washed away while
    invoking his name."

  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    Saul was still breathing threats to slaughter the Lord's disciples. He had
    gone to the high priest and asked for letters addressed to the synagogues in
    Damascus, that would authorise him to arrest and take to Jerusalem any
    followers of the Way, men or women, that he could find. Suddenly, while he
    was travelling to Damascus and just before he reached the city, there came a
    light from heaven all round him. He fell to the ground, and then he heard a
    voice saying, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?' 'Who are you, Lord?'
    he asked, and the voice answered, 'I am Jesus, and you are persecuting me.
    Get up now and go into the city, and you will be told what you have to do.'
    The men travelling with Saul stood there speechless, for though they heard
    the voice they could see no one. Saul got up from the ground, but even with
    his eyes wide open he could see nothing at all, and they had to lead him
    into Damascus by the hand. For three days he was without his sight, and took
    neither food nor drink. A disciple called Ananias who lived in Damascus had
    a vision in which he heard the Lord say to him, 'Ananias!' When he replied,
    'Here I am, Lord', the Lord said, 'You must go to Straight Street and ask
    the house of Judas for someone called Saul, who comes from Tarsus. At this
    moment he is praying, having had a vision of a man called Ananias coming in
    and laying hands on him to give him back his sight.' When he heard that,
    Ananias said, 'Lord, several people have told me about this man and all the
    harm he has been doing to your saints in Jerusalem. He has only come here
    because he holds a warrant from the chief priests to arrest everybody who
    invokes your name.' The Lord replied, 'You must go all the same, because
    this man is my chosen instrument to bring my name before pagans and pagan
    kings and before the people of Israel; I myself will show him how much he
    himself must suffer for my name'. Then Ananias went. He entered the house,
    and at once laid his hands on Saul and said, 'Brother Saul, I have been sent
    by the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on your way here so that you may
    recover your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit'. Immediately it was
    as though scales fell away from Saul's eyes and he could see again. So he
    was baptised there and then, and after taking some food he regained his
    strength. After he had spent only a few days with the disciples in Damascus,
    he began preaching in the synagogues, 'Jesus is the Son of God'. All his
    hearers were amazed. 'Surely' they said 'this is the man who organised the
    attack in Jerusalem against the people who invoke this name, and who came
    here for the sole purpose of arresting them to have them tried by the chief
    priests?' Saul's power increased steadily, and he was able to throw the
    Jewish colony at Damascus into complete confusion by the way be demonstrated
    that Jesus was the Christ.

    To pray better, keep a calm and sober mind. Above all, never let your love
    for each other grow insincere, since love covers over many a sin. Welcome
    each other into your houses without grumbling. Each one of you has received
    a special grace, so, like good stewards responsible for all these different
    graces of God, put yourselves at the service of others. If you are a
    speaker, speak in words which seem to come from God; if you are a helper,
    help as though every action was done at God's orders; so that in everything
    God may receive the glory, through Jesus Christ, since to him alone belong
    all glory and power for ever and ever. Amen.

    They had been discussing among themselves on the way who was the greatest.
    Then he sat down, called the Twelve, and said to them, “If anyone wishes to
    be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all.” Taking a
    child he placed it in their midst, and putting his arms around it he said to
    them, “Whoever receives one child such as this in my name, receives me; and
    whoever receives me, receives not me but the One who sent me.”

    Therefore I prayed, and prudence was given me; I pleaded and the spirit of
    Wisdom came to me. I preferred her to scepter and throne, And deemed riches
    nothing in comparison with her, nor did I liken any priceless gem to her;
    Because all gold, in view of her, is a bit of sand, and before her, silver
    is to be accounted mire. Beyond health and beauty I loved her, And I chose
    to have her rather than the light, because her radiance never ceases.
  </p>
  Now God grant I speak suitably and value these endowments at their worth: For
  he is the guide of Wisdom and the director of the wise. For both we and our
  words are in his hand, as well as all prudence and knowledge of crafts.
