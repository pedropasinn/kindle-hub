    Jesus began to make it clear to his disciples that he was destined to go to
    Jerusalem and suffer grievously at the hands of the elders and chief priests
    and scribes, to be put to death and to be raised up on the third day.
    &nbsp;Then, taking him aside, Peter started to remonstrate with him. 'Heaven
    preserve you, Lord;' he said 'this must not happen to you'. &nbsp;But he
    turned and said to Peter, 'Get behind me, Satan! You are an obstacle in my
    path, because the way you think is not God's way but man's.' &nbsp;Then
    Jesus said to his disciples, 'If anyone wants to be a follower of mine, let
    him renounce himself and take up his cross and follow me. &nbsp;For anyone
    who wants to save his life will lose it; but anyone who loses his life for
    my sake will find it. &nbsp;What, then, will a man gain if he wins the whole
    world and ruins his life? Or what has a man to offer in exchange for his
    life? &nbsp;'For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of his Father
    with his angels, and, when he does, he will reward each one according to his
    behaviour.

    The Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered
    round Jesus, &nbsp;and they noticed that some of his disciples were eating
    with unclean hands, that is, without washing them. &nbsp;For the Pharisees,
    and the Jews in general, follow the tradition of the elders and never eat
    without washing their arms as far as the elbow; &nbsp;and on returning from
    the market place they never eat without first sprinkling themselves. There
    are also many other observances which have been handed down to them
    concerning the washing of cups and pots and bronze dishes. &nbsp;So these
    Pharisees and scribes asked him, 'Why do your disciples not respect the
    tradition of the elders but eat their food with unclean hands?' &nbsp;He
    answered, 'It was of you hypocrites that Isaiah so rightly prophesied in
    this passage of scripture: This people honours me only with lip-service,
    while their hearts are far from me. &nbsp;The worship they offer me is
    worthless, the doctrines they teach are only human regulations. &nbsp;You
    put aside the commandment of God to cling to human traditions.' &nbsp;He
    called the people to him again and said, 'Listen to me, all of you, and
    understand. &nbsp;Nothing that goes into a man from outside can make him
    unclean; it is the things that come out of a man that make him unclean.
    &nbsp;For it is from within, from men's hearts, that evil intentions emerge:
    fornication, theft, murder, adultery, &nbsp;avarice, malice, deceit,
    indecency, envy, slander, pride, folly. &nbsp;All these evil things come
    from within and make a man unclean.'

    On a sabbath day Jesus had gone for a meal to the house of one of the
    leading Pharisees; and they watched him closely. &nbsp;He then told the
    guests a parable, because he had noticed how they picked the places of
    honour. He said this, &nbsp;'When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do
    not take your seat in the place of honour. A more distinguished person than
    you may have been invited, &nbsp;and the person who invited you both may
    come and say, "Give up your place to this man". And then, to your
    embarrassment, you would have to go and take the lowest place. &nbsp;No;
    when you are a guest, make your way to the lowest place and sit there, so
    that, when your host comes, he may say, "My friend, move up higher". In that
    way, everyone with you at the table will see you honoured. &nbsp;For
    everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the man who humbles himself
    will be exalted.' &nbsp;Then he said to his host, 'When you give a lunch or
    a dinner, do not ask your friends, brothers, relations or rich neighbours,
    for fear they repay your courtesy by inviting you in return. &nbsp;No; when
    you have a party, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind;
    &nbsp;that they cannot pay you back means that you are fortunate, because
    repayment will be made to you when the virtuous rise again.'

    are left alive until the Lord's coming will not have any advantage over
    those who have died. &nbsp;At the trumpet of God, the voice of the archangel

    Jesus came to Nazara, where he had been brought up, and went into the
    synagogue on the sabbath day as he usually did. He stood up to read
    &nbsp;and they handed him the scroll of the prophet Isaiah. Unrolling the
    scroll he found the place where it is written: &nbsp;The spirit of the Lord
    has been given to me, for he has anointed me. He has sent me to bring the
    good news to the poor, to proclaim liberty to captives and to the blind new
    sight, to set the downtrodden free, &nbsp;to proclaim the Lord's year of
    favour. &nbsp;He then rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the assistant
    and sat down. And all eyes in the synagogue were fixed on him. &nbsp;Then he
    began to speak to them, 'This text is being fulfilled today even as you
    listen'. &nbsp;And he won the approval of all, and they were astonished by
    the gracious words that came from his lips They said, 'This is Joseph's son,
    surely?' &nbsp;But he replied, 'No doubt you will quote me the saying,
    "Physician, heal yourself" and tell me, "We have heard all that happened in
    Capernaum, do the same here in your own countryside"'. &nbsp;And he went on,
    'I tell you solemnly, no prophet is ever accepted in his own country.
    &nbsp;'There were many widows in Israel, I can assure you, in Elijah's day,
    when heaven remained shut for three years and six months and a great famine
    raged throughout the land, &nbsp;but Elijah was not sent to any one of
    these: he was sent to a widow at Zarephath, a Sidonian town. &nbsp;And in
    the prophet Elisha's time there were many lepers in Israel, but none of
    these was cured, except the Syrian, Naaman.' &nbsp;When they heard this
    everyone in the synagogue was enraged. &nbsp;They sprang to their feet and
    hustled him out of the town; and they took him up to the brow of the hill
    their town was built on, intending to throw him down the cliff, &nbsp;but he
    slipped through the crowd and walked away.

    You will not be expecting us to write anything to you, brothers, about
    'times and seasons', &nbsp;since you know very well that the Day of the Lord
    is going to come like a thief in the night. &nbsp;It is when people are
    saying, 'How quiet and peaceful it is' that the worst suddenly happens, as
    suddenly as labour pains come on a pregnant woman; and there will be no way
    for anybody to evade it. &nbsp;But it is not as if you live in the dark, my
    brothers, for that Day to overtake you like a thief. &nbsp;No, you are all
    sons of light and sons of the day: we do not belong to the night or to
    darkness, &nbsp;so we should not go on sleeping, as everyone else does, but
    stay wide awake and sober. &nbsp;God never meant us to experience the
    Retribution, but to win salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, &nbsp;who
    died for us so that, alive or dead, we should still live united to him.
    &nbsp;So give encouragement to each other, and keep strengthening one
    another, as you do already.

    The Spirit reaches the depths of everything, even the depths of God.
    &nbsp;After all, the depths of a man can only be known by his own spirit,
    not by any other man, and in the same way the depths of God can only be
    known by the Spirit of God. &nbsp;Now instead of the spirit of the world, we
    have received the Spirit that comes from God, to teach us to understand the
    gifts that he has given us. &nbsp;Therefore we teach, not in the way in
    which philosophy is taught, but in the way that the Spirit teaches us: we
    teach spiritual things spiritually. &nbsp;An unspiritual person is one who
    does not accept anything of the Spirit of God: he sees it all as nonsense;
    it is beyond his understanding because it can only be understood by means of
    the Spirit. &nbsp;A spiritual man, on the other hand, is able to judge the
    value of everything, and his own value is not to be judged by other men.
    &nbsp;As scripture says: Who can know the mind of the Lord, so who can teach
    him? But we are those who have the mind of Christ.

    Jesus went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and taught them on the
    sabbath.&nbsp;And his teaching made a deep impression on them because he
    spoke with authority. &nbsp;In the synagogue there was a man who was
    possessed by the spirit of an unclean devil, and it shouted at the top of
    its voice, &nbsp;'Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you
    come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God.' &nbsp;But
    Jesus said sharply, 'Be quiet! Come out of him!' And the devil, throwing the
    man down in front of everyone, went out of him without hurting him at all.
    &nbsp;Astonishment seized them and they were all saying to one another,
    'What teaching! He gives orders to unclean spirits with authority and power
    and they come out.' &nbsp;And reports of him went all through the
    surrounding countryside.

    Brothers, I myself was unable to speak to you as people of the Spirit: I

    with was milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it; and indeed,
    you are still not ready for it &nbsp;since you are still unspiritual. Isn't

    Apollos'? &nbsp;After all, what is Apollos and what is Paul? They are
    servants who brought the faith to you. Even the different ways in which they
    brought it were assigned to them by the Lord. &nbsp;I did the planting,

    Leaving the synagogue Jesus went to Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law
    was suffering from a high fever and they asked him to do something for her.
    &nbsp;Leaning over her he rebuked the fever and it left her. And she
    immediately got up and began to wait on them. &nbsp;At sunset all those who
    had friends suffering from diseases of one kind or another brought them to
    him, and laying his hands on each he cured them. &nbsp;Devils too came out
    of many people, howling, 'You are the Son of God'. But he rebuked them and
    would not allow them to speak because they knew that he was the Christ.
    &nbsp;When daylight came he left the house and made his way to a lonely
    place. The crowds went to look for him, and when they had caught up with him
    they wanted to prevent him leaving them, &nbsp;but he answered, 'I must
    proclaim the Good News of the kingdom of God to the other towns too, because
    that is what I was sent to do'. &nbsp;And he continued his preaching in the
    synagogues of Judaea.

    Make no mistake about it: if any one of you thinks of himself as wise, in
    the ordinary sense of the word, then he must learn to be a fool before he
    really can be wise. &nbsp;Why? Because the wisdom of this world is
    foolishness to God. As scripture says: The Lord knows wise men's thoughts:
    he knows how useless they are: &nbsp;or again: God is not convinced by the

    Jesus was standing one day by the Lake of Gennesaret, with the crowd
    pressing round him listening to the word of God, &nbsp;when he caught sight
    of two boats close to the bank. The fishermen had gone out of them and were
    washing their nets. &nbsp;He got into one of the boats -it was Simon's- and
    asked him to put out a little from the shore. Then he sat down and taught
    the crowds from the boat. &nbsp;When he had finished speaking he said to
    Simon, 'Put out into deep water and pay out your nets for a catch'.
    &nbsp;'Master,' Simon replied 'we worked hard all night long and caught
    nothing, but if you say so, I will pay out the nets.' &nbsp;And when they
    had done this they netted such a huge number of fish that their nets began
    to tear, &nbsp;so they signaled to their companions in the other boat to
    come and help them; when these came, they filled the two boats to sinking
    point. &nbsp;When Simon Peter saw this he fell at the knees of Jesus saying,
    'Leave me, Lord; I am a sinful man'. &nbsp;For he and all his companions
    were completely overcome by the catch they had made; &nbsp;so also were
    James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were Simon's partners. But Jesus said
    to Simon, 'Do not be afraid; from now on it is men you will catch'.
    &nbsp;Then, bringing their boats back to land, they left everything and
    followed him.

    The Pharisees and the Scribes said to Jesus, 'John's disciples are always
    fasting and saying prayers, and the disciples of the Pharisees too, but
    yours go on eating and drinking'. &nbsp;Jesus replied, 'Surely you cannot
    make the bridegroom's attendants fast while the bridegroom is still with
    them? &nbsp;But the time will come, the time for the bridegroom to be taken
    away from them; that will be the time when they will fast.' &nbsp;He also
    told them this parable, 'No one tears a piece from a new cloak to put it on
    an old cloak; if he does, not only will he have torn the new one, but the
    piece taken from the new will not match the old. &nbsp;'And nobody puts new
    wine into old skins; if he does, the new wine will burst the skins and then
    run out, and the skins will be lost. &nbsp;No; new wine must be put into
    fresh skins. &nbsp;And nobody who has been drinking old wine wants new. "The

    put us apostles at the end of his parade, with the men sentenced to death;
    it is true - we have been put on show in front of the whole universe, angels
    as well as men. &nbsp;Here we are, fools for the sake of Christ, while you
    are the learned men in Christ; we have no power, but you are influential;
    you are celebrities, we are nobodies. &nbsp;To this day, we go without food
