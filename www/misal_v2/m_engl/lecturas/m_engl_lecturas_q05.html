    People who are interested only in unspiritual things can never be pleasing
    to God. Your interests, however, are not in the unspiritual, but in the
    spiritual, since the Spirit of God has made his home in you. In fact, unless
    you possessed the Spirit of Christ you would not belong to him. Though your
    body may be dead it is because of sin, but if Christ is in you then your
    spirit is life itself because you have been justified; and if the Spirit of
    him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, then he who raised

    There was a man named Lazarus who lived in the village of Bethany with the
    two sisters, Mary and Martha, and he was ill. - It was the same Mary, the
    sister of the sick man Lazarus, who anointed the Lord with ointment and
    wiped his feet with her hair. The sisters sent this message to Jesus, 'Lord,
    the man you love is ill'. On receiving the message, Jesus said, 'This
    sickness will end not in death but in God's glory, and through it the Son of
    God will be glorified'. Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus, yet
    when he heard that Lazarus was ill he stayed where he was for two more days
    before saying to the disciples, 'Let us go to Judaea '. The disciples said,
    'Rabbi, it is not long since the Jews wanted to stone you; are you going
    back again?' Jesus replied: 'Are there not twelve hours in the day? A man
    can walk in the daytime without stumbling because he has the light of this
    world to see by; but if he walks at night he stumbles, because there is no
    light to guide him.' He said that and then added, 'Our friend Lazarus is
    resting, I am going to wake him'. The disciples said to him, 'Lord, if he is
    able to rest he is sure to get better'. The phrase Jesus used referred to
    the death of Lazarus, but they thought that by 'rest' he meant 'sleep', so
    Jesus put it plainly, 'Lazarus is dead; and for your sake I am glad I was
    not there because now you will believe. But let us go to him.' Then Thomas -
    known as the Twin - said to the other disciples, 'Let us go too, and die
    with him'. On arriving, Jesus found that Lazarus had been in the tomb for
    four days already. Bethany is only about two miles from Jerusalem, and many
    Jews had come to Martha and Mary to sympathise with them over their brother.
    When Martha heard that Jesus had come she went to meet him. Mary remained
    sitting in the house. Martha said to Jesus, 'If you had been here, my
    brother would not have died, but I know that, even now, whatever you ask of
    God, he will grant you'. 'Your brother' said Jesus to her 'will rise again.'
    Martha said, ' know he will rise again at the resurrection on the last day'.
    Jesus said: 'I am the resurrection. If anyone believes in me, even though he
    dies he will live, and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do
    you believe this?' 'Yes, Lord,' she said 'I believe that you are the Christ,
    the Son of God, the one who was to come into this world.' When she had said
    this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in a low voice, 'The
    Master is here and wants to see you'. Hearing this, Mary got up quickly and
    went to him. Jesus had not yet come into the village; he was still at the
    place where Martha had met him. When the Jews who were in the house
    sympathising with Mary saw her get up so quickly and go out, they followed
    her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there. Mary went to
    Jesus, and as soon as she saw him she threw herself at his feet, saying,
    'Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died'. At the sight
    of her tears, and those of the Jews who followed her, Jesus said in great
    distress, with a sigh that came straight from the heart, 'Where have you put
    him?' They said, 'Lord, come and see'. Jesus wept; and the Jews said, 'See
    how much he loved him!' But there were some who remarked, 'He opened the
    eyes of the blind man, could he not have prevented this man's death?' Still
    sighing, Jesus reached the tomb: it was a cave with a stone to close the
    opening. Jesus said, 'Take the stone away'. Martha said to him, 'Lord, by
    now he will smell; this is the fourth day'. Jesus replied, 'Have I not told
    you that if you believe you will see the glory of God?' So they took away
    the stone. Then Jesus lifted up his eyes and said: 'Father, I thank you for
    hearing my prayer. I knew indeed that you always hear me, but I speak for
    the sake of all these who stand round me, so that they may believe it was
    you who sent me.' When he had said this, he cried in a loud voice, 'Lazarus,
    here! Come out!' The dead man came out, his feet and hands bound with bands
    of stuff and a cloth round his face. Jesus said to them, 'Unbind him, let
    him go free'. Many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary and had seen what
    he did believed in him.

    Among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks. These
    approached Philip, who came from Bethsaida in Galilee, and put this request
    to him, 'Sir, we should like to see Jesus'. Philip went to tell Andrew, and
    Andrew and Philip together went to tell Jesus. Jesus replied to them: 'Now
    the hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. I tell you, most
    solemnly, unless a wheat grain falls on the ground and dies, it remains only
    a single grain; but if it dies, it yields a rich harvest. Anyone who loves
    his life loses it; anyone who hates his life in this world will keep it for
    the eternal life. If a man serves me, he must follow me, wherever I am, my
    servant will be there too. If anyone serves me, my Father will honour him.
    Now my soul is troubled. What shall I say: Father, save me from this hour?
    But it was for this very reason that I have come to this hour. Father,
    glorify your name!' A voice came from heaven, 'I have glorified it, and I
    will glorify it again.' People standing by, who heard this, said it was a
    clap of thunder; others said, 'It was an angel speaking to him'. Jesus
    answered, 'It was not for my sake that this voice came, but for yours. 'Now
    sentence is being passed on this world; now the prince of this world is to
    be overthrown. And when I am lifted up from the earth, I shall draw all men
    to myself.' By these words he indicated the kind of death he would die.

    I believe nothing can happen that will outweigh the supreme advantage of

    everything, and I look on everything as so much rubbish if only I can have
    Christ and be given a place in him. I am no longer trying for perfection by
    my own efforts, the perfection that comes from the Law, but I want only the
    perfection that comes through faith in Christ, and is from God and based on
    faith. All I want is to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and to
    share his sufferings by reproducing the pattern of his death. That is the
    way I can hope to take my place in the resurrection of the dead. Not that I
    have become perfect yet: I have not yet won, but I am still running, trying
    to capture the prize for which Christ Jesus captured me. I can assure you my

    Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. At daybreak he appeared in the Temple
    again; and as all the people came to him, he sat down and began to teach
    them. The scribes and Pharisees brought a woman along who had been caught
    committing adultery; and making her stand there in full view of everybody,
    they said to Jesus, 'Master, this woman was caught in the very act of
    committing adultery, and Moses has ordered us in the Law to condemn women
    like this to death by stoning. What have you to say?' They asked him this as
    a test, looking for something to use against him. But Jesus bent down and
    started writing on the ground with his finger. As they persisted with their
    question, he looked up and said, 'If there is one of you who has not sinned,
    let him be the first to throw a stone at her'. Then be bent down and wrote
    on the ground again. When they heard this they went away one by one,
    beginning with the eldest, until Jesus was left alone with the woman, who
    remained standing there. He looked up and said, 'Woman, where are they? Has
    no one condemned you?' 'No one, sir' she replied. 'Neither do I condemn
    you,' said Jesus 'go away, and don't sin any more.'

  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    In Babylon there lived a man named Joakim. He had married Susanna daughter
    of Hilkiah, a woman of great beauty; and she was God-fearing, because her
    parents were worthy people and had instructed their daughter in the Law of
    Moses. Joakim was a very rich man, and had a garden attached to his house;
    the Jews would often visit him since he was held in greater respect than any
    other man. Two elderly men had been selected from the people that year to
    act as judges. Of such the Lord said, 'Wickedness has come to Babylon
    through the elders and judges posing as guides to the people'. These men
    were often at Joakim's house, and all who were engaged in litigation used to
    come to them. At midday, when everyone had gone, Susanna used to take a walk
    in her husband's garden. The two elders, who used to watch her every day as
    she came in to take her walk, gradually began to desire her. They threw
    reason aside, making no effort to turn their eyes to heaven, and forgetting
    its demands of virtue. So they waited for a favourable moment; and one day
    Susanna came as usual, accompanied only by two young maidservants. The day
    was hot and she wanted to bathe in the garden. There was no one about except
    the two elders, spying on her from their hiding place. She said to the
    servants, 'Bring me some oil and balsam and shut the garden door while I
    bathe'. Hardly were the servants gone than the two elders were there after
    her. 'Look,' they said 'the garden door is shut, no one can see us. We want
    to have you, so give in and let us! Refuse, and we will both give evidence
    that a young man was with you and that was why you sent your maids away.'
    Susanna sighed. 'I am trapped,' she said 'whatever I do. If I agree, that
    means my death; if I resist, I cannot get away from you. But I prefer to
    fall innocent into your power than to sin in the eyes of the Lord.' Then she
    cried out as loud as she could. The two elders began shouting too, putting
    the blame on her, and one of them ran to open the garden door. The
    household, hearing the shouting in the garden, rushed out by the side
    entrance to see what was happening; once the elders had told their story the
    servants were thoroughly taken aback, since nothing of this sort had ever
    been said of Susanna. Next day a meeting was held at the house of her
    husband Joakim. The two elders arrived, in their vindictiveness determined
    to have her put to death. They addressed the company: 'Summon Susanna
    daughter of Hilkiah and wife of Joakim'. She was sent for, and came
    accompanied by her parents, her children and all her relations. All her own
    people were weeping, and so were all the others who saw her. The two elders
    stood up, with all the people round them, and laid their hands on the
    woman's head. Tearfully she turned her eyes to heaven, her heart confident
    in God. The elders then spoke. 'While we were walking by ourselves in the
    garden, this woman arrived with two servants. She shut the garden door and
    then dismissed the servants. A young man who had been hiding went over to
    her and they lay down together. From the end of the garden where we were, we
    saw this crime taking place and hurried towards them. Though we saw them
    together we were unable to catch the man: he was too strong for us; he
    opened the door and took to his heels. We did, however, catch this woman and
    ask her who the young man was. She refused to tell us. That is our
    evidence.' Since they were elders of the people, and judges, the assembly
    took their word: Susanna was condemned to death. She cried out as loud as
    she could, 'Eternal God, you know all secrets and everything before it
    happens; you know that they have given false evidence against me. And now
    have I to die, innocent as I am of everything their malice has invented
    against me?' The Lord heard her cry and, as she was being led away to die,
    he roused the holy spirit residing in a young boy named Daniel who began to
    shout, 'I am innocent of this woman's death!' At which all the people turned
    to him and asked, 'What do you mean by these words?' Standing in the middle
    of the crowd he replied, 'Are you so stupid, sons of Israel, as to condemn a
    daughter of Israel unheard, and without troubling to find out the truth? Go
    back to the scene of the trial: these men have given false evidence against
    her.' All the people hurried back, and the elders said to Daniel, 'Come and
    sit with us and tell us what you mean, since God has given you the gifts
    that elders have'. Daniel said, 'Keep the men well apart from each other for
    I want to question them'. When the men had been separated, Daniel had one of
    them brought to him. 'You have grown old in wickedness,' he said 'and now
    the sins of your earlier days have overtaken you, you with your unjust
    judgements, your condemnation of the innocent, your acquittal of guilty men,
    when the Lord has said, "You must not put the innocent and the just to
    death". Now then, since you saw her so clearly, tell me what tree you saw
    them lying under?' He replied, 'Under a mastic tree'. Daniel said, 'True
    enough! Your lie recoils on your own head: the angel of God has already
    received your sentence from him and will slash you in half.' He dismissed
    the man, ordered the other to be brought and said to him, 'Spawn of Canaan,
    not of Judah, beauty has seduced you, lust has led your heart astray! This
    is how you have been behaving with the daughters of Israel and they were too
    frightened to resist; but here is a daughter of Judah who could not stomach
    your wickedness! Now then, tell me what tree you surprised them under?' He
    replied, 'Under a holm oak'. Daniel said, 'True enough! Your lie recoils on
    your own head: the angel of God is waiting, with a sword to drive home and
    split you, and destroy the pair of you.' Then the whole assembly shouted,
    blessing God, the saviour of those who trust in him. And they turned on the
    two elders whom Daniel had convicted of false evidence out of their own
    mouths. As prescribed in the Law of Moses, they sentenced them to the same
    punishment as they had intended to inflict on their neighbour. They put them
    to death; the life of an innocent woman was spared that day.

    Jesus said to the Pharisees: 'I am the light of the world; anyone who
    follows me will not be walking in the dark; he will have the light of life'.
    At this the Pharisees said to him, 'You are testifying on your own behalf;
    your testimony is not valid'. Jesus replied: 'It is true that I am
    testifying on my own behalf, but my testimony is still valid, because I know
    where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come
    from or where I am going. You judge by human standards; I judge no one, but
    if I judge, my judgment will be sound, because I am not alone: the one who
    sent me is with me; and in your Law it is written that the testimony of two
    witnesses is valid. I may be testifying on my own behalf, but the Father who
    sent me is my witness too.' They asked him, 'Where is your Father?' Jesus
    answered: 'You do not know me, nor do you know my Father; if you did know
    me, you would know my Father as well'. He spoke these words in the Treasury,
    while teaching in the Temple. No one arrested him, because his time had not
    yet come.

    The Israelites left Mount Hor by the road to the Sea of Suph, to skirt the
    land of Edom. On the way the people lost patience. They spoke against God
    and against Moses, 'Why did you bring us out of Egypt to die in this
    wilderness? For there is neither bread nor water here; we are sick of this
    unsatisfying food.' At this God sent fiery serpents among the people; their
    bite brought death to many in Israel. The people came and said to Moses, 'We
    have sinned by speaking against the Lord and against you. Intercede for us
    with the Lord to save us from these serpents.' Moses interceded for the
    people, and the Lord answered him, 'Make a fiery serpent and put it on a
    standard. If anyone is bitten and looks at it, he shall live.' So Moses
    fashioned a bronze serpent which he put on a standard, and if anyone was
    bitten by a serpent, he looked at the bronze serpent and lived.

    Jesus said to the Pharisees: 'I am going away; you will look for me and you
    will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.' The Jews said to
    one another, 'Will he kill himself? Is that what he means by saying, "Where
    I am going, you cannot come"?' Jesus went on: 'You are from below; I am from
    above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. I have told you
    already: You will die in your sins. Yes, if you do not believe that I am He,
    you will die in your sins.' So they said to him, 'Who are you?' Jesus
    answered: 'What I have told you from the outset. About you I have much to
    say and much to condemn; but the one who sent me is truthful, and what I
    have learnt from him I declare to the world.' They failed to understand that
    he was talking to them about the Father. So Jesus said: 'When you have
    lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He and that I do
    nothing of myself: what the Father has taught me is what I preach; he who
    sent me is with me, and has not left me to myself, for I always do what
    pleases him'. As he was saying this, many came to believe in him.

  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    King Nebuchadnezzar said, 'Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, is it true that
    you do not serve my gods, and that you refuse to worship the golden statue I
    have erected? When you hear the sound of horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp,
    bagpipe, or any other instrument, are you prepared to prostrate yourselves
    and worship the statue I have made? If you refuse to worship it, you must be
    thrown straight away into the burning fiery furnace; and where is the god
    who could save you from my power?' Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to
    King Nebuchadnezzar, 'Your question hardly requires an answer: if our God,
    the one we serve, is able to save us from the burning fiery furnace and from
    your power, O king, he will save us; and even if he does not, then you must
    know, O king, that we will not serve your god or worship the statue you have
    erected'. These words infuriated King Nebuchadnezzar; his expression was
    very different now as he looked at Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. He gave
    orders for the furnace to be made seven times hotter than usual, and
    commanded certain stalwarts from his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach and
    Abednego and throw them into the burning fiery furnace. Then King
    Nebuchadnezzar sprang to his feet in amazement. He said to his advisers,
    'Did we not have these three men thrown bound into the fire?' They replied,
    'Certainly, O king'. 'But,' he went on 'I can see four men walking about
    freely in the heart of the fire without coming to any harm. And the fourth
    looks like a son of the gods.' Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed, 'Blessed be the God
    of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego: he has sent his angel to rescue his
    servants who, putting their trust in him, defied the order of the king, and
    preferred to forfeit their bodies rather than serve or worship any god but
    their own.

    To the Jews who believed in him Jesus said: 'If you make my word your home
    you will indeed be my disciples, you will learn the truth and the truth will
    make you free'. They answered, 'We are descended from Abraham and we have
    never been the slaves of anyone; what do you mean, "You will be made free"?'
    Jesus replied: 'I tell you most solemnly, everyone who commits sin is a
    slave. Now the slave's place in the house is not assured, but the son's
    place is assured. So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed. I
    know that you are descended from Abraham; but in spite of that you want to
    kill me because nothing I say has penetrated into you. What I; for my part,
    speak of is what I have seen with my Father; but you, you put into action
    the lessons learnt from your father.' They repeated, 'Our father is
    Abraham'. Jesus said to them: 'If you were Abraham's children, you would do
    as Abraham did. As it is, you want to kill me when I tell you the truth as I
    have learnt it from God; that is not what Abraham did. What you are doing is
    what your father does.' 'We were not born of prostitution,' they went on 'we
    have one father: God.' Jesus answered: 'If God were your father, you would
    love me, since I have come here from God; yes, I have come from him; not
    that I came because I chose, no, I was sent, and by him.

    Jesus said to the Jews: I tell you most solemnly, whoever keeps my word will
    never see death.' The Jews said, 'Now we know for certain that you are
    possessed. Abraham is dead, and the prophets are dead, and yet you say,
    "Whoever keeps my word will never know the taste of death". Are you greater
    than our father Abraham, who is dead? The prophets are dead too. Who are you
    claiming to be?' Jesus answered: 'If I were to seek my own glory that would
    be no glory at all; my glory is conferred by the Father, by the one of whom
    you say, "He is our God" although you do not know him. But I know him, and
    if I were to say: I do not know him, I should be a liar, as you are liars
    yourselves. But I do know him, and I faithfully keep his word. Your father
    Abraham rejoiced to think that he would see my Day; he saw it and was glad.'
    The Jews then said, 'You are not fifty yet, and you have seen Abraham!'
    Jesus replied: 'I tell you most solemnly, before Abraham ever was, I Am'. At
    this they picked up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself and left
    the Temple.

    The Jews fetched stones to stone him, so Jesus said to them, 'I have done
    many good works for you to see, works from my Father; for which of these are
    you stoning me?' The Jews answered him, 'We are not stoning you for doing a
    good work but for blasphemy: you are only a man and you claim to be God.'
    Jesus answered: 'Is it not written in your Law: I said, you are gods? So the
    Law uses the word gods of those to whom the word of God was addressed, and
    scripture cannot be rejected. Yet you say to someone the Father has
    consecrated and sent into the world, "You are blaspheming", because he says,
    "I am the son of God". If I am not doing my Father's work, there is no need
    to believe me; but if I am doing it, then even if you refuse to believe in
    me, at least believe in the work I do; then you will know for sure that the
    Father is in me and I am in the Father.' They wanted to arrest him then, but
    he eluded them. He went back again to the far side of the Jordan to stay in
    the district where John had once been baptising. Many people who came to him
    there said, 'John gave no signs, but all he said about this man was true';
    and many of them believed in him.

    Many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did
    believed in him, but some of them went to tell the Pharisees what Jesus had
    done. Then the chief priests and Pharisees called a meeting. 'Here is this
    man working all these signs' they said 'and what action are we taking? If we
    let him go on in this way everybody will believe in him, and the Romans will
    come and destroy the Holy Place and our nation.' One of them, Caiaphas, the
    high priest that year, said, 'You don't seem to have grasped the situation
    at all; you fail to see that it is better for one man to die for the people,
    than for the whole nation to be destroyed'. He did not speak in his own
    person, it was as high priest that he made this prophecy that Jesus was to
    die for the nation - and not for the nation only, but to gather together in
    unity the scattered children of God. From that day they were determined to
    kill him. So Jesus no longer went about openly among the Jews, but left the
    district for a town called Ephraim, in the country bordering on the desert,
    and stayed there with his disciples. The Jewish Passover drew near, and many
    of the country people who had gone up to Jerusalem to purify themselves
    looked out for Jesus, saying to one another as they stood about in the
    Temple, 'What do you think? Will he come to the festival or not?' For the
    chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where
    he was, he should inform them, so that they might arrest him.
