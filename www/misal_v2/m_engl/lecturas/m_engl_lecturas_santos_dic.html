    I do not boast of preaching the gospel, since it is a duty which has been
    laid on me; I should be punished if I did not preach it! &nbsp;If I had
    chosen this work myself, I might have been paid for it, but as I have not,
    it is a responsibility which has been put into my hands. &nbsp;Do you know
    what my reward is? It is this in my preaching, to be able to offer the Good
    News free, and not insist on the rights which the gospel gives me. &nbsp;So
    though I am not a slave of any man I have made myself the slave of everyone
    so as to win as many as I could. &nbsp;I made myself all things to all men
    in order to save some at any cost; &nbsp;and I still do this, for the sake
    of the gospel, to have a share in its blessings.

    In the year of King Uzziah's death I saw the Lord seated on a high throne;
    his train filled the sanctuary; above him stood seraphs, each one with six
    wings: two to cover its face, two to cover its feet and two for flying. And
    they cried out one to another in this way, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of
    hosts. His glory fills the whole earth.' The foundations of the threshold
    shook with the voice of the one who cried out and the Temple was filled with
    smoke. I said: 'What a wretched state I am in! I am lost, for I am a man of
    unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have
    looked at the King, Lord of hosts.' Then one of the seraphs flew to me,
    holding in his hand a live coal which he had taken from the altar with a
    pair of tongs. With this he touched my mouth and said: 'See now, this has
    touched your lips, your sin is taken away, your iniquity is purged'. Then I
    heard the voice of the Lord saying: 'Whom shall I send? Who will be our
    messenger?' I answered, 'Here I am, send me'.

    The Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them out ahead of him, in
    pairs, to all the towns and places he himself was to visit. He said to them,
    'The harvest is rich but the labourers are few, so ask the Lord of the
    harvest to send labourers to his harvest. Start off now, but remember, I am
    sending you out like lambs among wolves. Carry no purse, no haversack, no
    sandals. Salute no one on the road. Whatever house you go into, let your
    first words be, "Peace to this house!" And if a man of peace lives there,
    your peace will go and rest on him; if not, it will come back to you. Stay
    in the same house, taking what food and drink they have to offer, for the
    labourer deserves his wages; do not move from house to house. Whenever you
    go into a town where they make you welcome, eat what is set before you. Cure
    those in it who are sick, and say, "The kingdom of God is very near to you".

    In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee
    called Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the House
    of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. He went in and said to her,
    'Rejoice, so highly favoured! The Lord is with you.' She was deeply
    disturbed by these words and asked herself what this greeting could mean,
    but the angel said to her, 'Mary, do not be afraid; you have won God's
    favour. Listen! You are to conceive and bear a son, and you must name him
    Jesus. He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High. The Lord
    God will give him the throne of his ancestor David; he will rule over the
    House of Jacob for ever and his reign will have no end.' Mary said to the
    angel, 'But how can this come about, since I am a virgin?' 'The Holy Spirit
    will come upon you' the angel answered 'and the power of the Most High will
    cover you with its shadow. And so the child will be holy and will be called
    Son of God. Know this too: your kinswoman Elizabeth has, in her old age,
    herself conceived a son, and she whom people called barren is now in her
    sixth month, for nothing is impossible to God' 'I am the handmaid of the
    Lord,' said Mary 'let what you have said be done to me.' And the angel left
    her.

    with the sun, standing on the moon, and with the twelve stars on her head
    for a crown.&nbsp;She was pregnant, and in labour, crying aloud in the pangs
    of childbirth.&nbsp;Then a second sign appeared in the sky, a huge red
    dragon which had seven heads and ten horns, and each of the seven heads
    crowned with a coronet.&nbsp;Its tail dragged a third of the stars from the
    sky and dropped them to the earth, and the dragon stopped in front of the
    woman as she was having the child, so that he could eat it as soon as it was
    born from its mother.&nbsp;The woman brought a male child into the world,
    the son who was to rule all the nations with an iron sceptre, and the child
    was taken straight up to God and to his throne,&nbsp;while the woman escaped
    into the desert, where God had made a place of safety ready, for her to be

    Stephen was filled with grace and power and began to work miracles and great
    signs among the people. But then certain people came forward to debate with
    Stephen, some from Cyrene and Alexandria who were members of the synagogue
    called the Synagogue of Freedmen, and others from Cilicia and Asia. They
    found they could not get the better of him because of his wisdom, and
    because it was the Spirit that prompted what he said. They were infuriated
    when they heard this, and ground their teeth at him. But Stephen, filled
    with the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus
    standing at God's right hand. 'I can see heaven thrown open' he said 'and
    the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.' At this all the members
    of the council shouted out and stopped their ears with their hands; then
    they all rushed at him, sent him out of the city and stoned him. The
    witnesses put down their clothes at the feet of a young man called Saul. As
    they were stoning him, Stephen said in invocation, 'Lord Jesus, receive my
    spirit'. Then he knelt down and said aloud, 'Lord, do not hold this sin
    against them'.

    Jesus said to his apostles: 'Beware of men: they will hand you over to
    sanhedrins and scourge you in their synagogues. You will be dragged before
    governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the pagans.
    But when they hand you over, do not worry about how to speak or what to say;
    what you are to say will be given to you when the time comes; because it is
    not you who will be speaking; the Spirit of your Father will be speaking in
    you. 'Brother will betray brother to death, and the father his child;
    children will rise against their parents and have them put to death. You
    will be hated by all men on account of my name; but the man who stands firm
    to the end will be saved.

    On the first day of the week Mary of Magdala came running to Simon Peter and
    the other disciple, the one Jesus loved. 'They have taken the Lord out of
    the tomb' she said 'and we don't know where they have put him.' So Peter set
    out with the other disciple to go to the tomb. They ran together, but the
    other disciple, running faster than Peter, reached the tomb first; he bent
    down and saw the linen cloths lying on the ground, but did not go in. Simon
    Peter who was following now came up, went right into the tomb, saw the linen
    cloths on the ground, and also the cloth that had been over his head; this
    was not with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the
    other disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in; he saw and he
    believed.

    This is what we have heard from him, and the message that we are announcing
    to you: God is light; there is no darkness in him at all. If we say that we
    are in union with God while we are living in darkness, we are lying because
    we are not living the truth. But if we live our lives in the light, as he is
    in the light, we are in union with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his
    Son, purifies us from all sin. If we say we have no sin in us; we are
    deceiving ourselves and refusing to admit the truth; but if we acknowledge
    our sins, then God who is faithful and just will forgive our sins and purify
    us from everything that is wrong. To say that we have never sinned is to
    call God a liar and to show that his word is not in us. I am writing this,
    my children, to stop you sinning; but if anyone should sin, we have our
    advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, who is just; he is the sacrifice
    that takes our sins away, and not only ours, but the whole world's.

    After the wise men had left, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a
    dream and said, 'Get up, take the child and his mother with you, and escape
    into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search
    for the child and do away with him'. So Joseph got up and, taking the child
    and his mother with him, left that night for Egypt, where he stayed until
    Herod was dead. This was to fulfil what the Lord had spoken through the
    prophet: I called my son out of Egypt. Herod was furious when he realised
    that he had been outwitted by the wise men, and in Bethlehem and its
    surrounding district he had all the male children killed who were two years
    old or under, reckoning by the date he had been careful to ask the wise men.
    It was then that the words spoken through the prophet Jeremiah were
    fulfilled: A voice was heard in Ramah, sobbing and loudly lamenting: it was
    Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted because they were
    no more.
