    Every year the parents of Jesus used to go to Jerusalem for the feast of the
    Passover. When he was twelve years old, they went up for the feast as usual.
  </p>
  <p>
    When they were on their way home after the feast, the boy Jesus stayed
    behind in Jerusalem without his parents knowing it. They assumed he was with
    the caravan, and it was only after a day's journey that they went to look
    for him among their relations and acquaintances.
  </p>
  <p>
    When they failed to find him they went back to Jerusalem looking for him
    everywhere. Three days later, they found him in the Temple, sitting among
    the doctors, listening to them, and asking them questions; and all those who
    heard him were astounded at his intelligence and his replies.
  </p>
  <p>
    They were overcome when they saw him, and his mother said to him, 'My child,
    why have, you done this to us? See how worried your father and I have been,
    looking for you.' 'Why were you looking for me?' he replied 'Did you not
    know that I must be busy with my Father's affairs?' But they did not
    understand what he meant.
  </p>
  <p>
    He then went down with them and came to Nazareth and lived under their
    authority. His mother stored up all these things in her heart.

    The Lord is the living stone, rejected by men but chosen by God and precious
    to him; set yourselves close to him so that you too, the holy priesthood
    that offers the spiritual sacrifices which Jesus Christ has made acceptable
    to God, may be living stones making a spiritual house. As scripture says:
    See how I lay in Zion a precious cornerstone that I have chosen and the man
    who rests his trust on it will not be disappointed. That means that for you
    who are believers, it is precious; but for unbelievers, the stone rejected
    by the builders has proved to be the keystone, a stone to stumble over, a
    rock to bring men down. They stumble over it because they do not believe in
    the word; it was the fate in store for them. But you are a chosen race, a

    Jesus entered Jericho and was going through the town&nbsp;when a man whose
    name was Zacchaeus made his appearance; he was one of the senior tax
    collectors and a wealthy man.&nbsp;He was anxious to see what kind of man
    Jesus was, but he was too short and could not see him for the crowd;&nbsp;So
    he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to catch a glimpse of Jesus who was
    to pass that way.&nbsp;When Jesus reached the spot he looked up and spoke to
    him: 'Zacchaeus, come down. Hurry, because I must stay at your house
    today.'&nbsp;And he hurried down and welcomed him joyfully.&nbsp;They all
    complained when they saw what was happening. 'He has gone to stay at a
    sinner's house' they said.&nbsp;But Zacchaeus stood his ground and said to
    the Lord, 'Look, sir, I am going to give half my property to the poor, and
    if I have cheated anybody I will pay him back four times the
    amount'&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, 'Today salvation has come to this house,

    Jesus was standing one day by the Lake of Gennesaret, with the crowd
    pressing round him listening to the word of God, &nbsp;when he caught sight
    of two boats close to the bank. The fishermen had gone out of them and were
    washing their nets. &nbsp;He got into one of the boats -it was Simon's- and
    asked him to put out a little from the shore. Then he sat down and taught
    the crowds from the boat. &nbsp;When he had finished speaking he said to
    Simon, 'Put out into deep water and pay out your nets for a catch'.
    &nbsp;'Master,' Simon replied 'we worked hard all night long and caught
    nothing, but if you say so, I will pay out the nets.' &nbsp;And when they
    had done this they netted such a huge number of fish that their nets began
    to tear, &nbsp;so they signaled to their companions in the other boat to
    come and help them; when these came, they filled the two boats to sinking
    point. &nbsp;When Simon Peter saw this he fell at the knees of Jesus saying,
    'Leave me, Lord; I am a sinful man'. &nbsp;For he and all his companions
    were completely overcome by the catch they had made; &nbsp;so also were
    James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were Simon's partners. But Jesus said
    to Simon, 'Do not be afraid; from now on it is men you will catch'.
    &nbsp;Then, bringing their boats back to land, they left everything and
    followed him.

    At this time the disciples came to Jesus and said, 'Who is the greatest in
    the kingdom of heaven?' &nbsp;So he called a little child to him and set the
    child in front of them. &nbsp;Then he said, 'I tell you solemnly, unless you
    change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of
    heaven. &nbsp;And so, the one who makes himself as little as this little
    child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. &nbsp;'Anyone who welcomes a
    little child like this in my name welcomes me. &nbsp;'See that you never
    despise any of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven
    are continually in the presence of my Father in heaven.

  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    Blessed be God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with
    all the spiritual blessings of heaven in Christ. Before the world was made,
    he chose us, chose us in Christ, to be holy and spotless, and to live
    through love in his presence, determining that we should become his adopted
    sons, through Jesus Christ for his own kind purposes, to make us praise the
    glory of his grace, his free gift to us in the Beloved, in whom, through his
    blood, we gain our freedom, the forgiveness of our sins. Such is the
    richness of the grace which he has showered on us in all wisdom and insight.
    He has let us know the mystery of his purpose, the hidden plan he so kindly
    made in Christ from the beginning to act upon when the times had run their
    course to the end: that he would bring everything together under Christ, as
    head, everything in the heavens and everything on earth. And it is in him
    that we were claimed as God's own, chosen from the beginning, under the
    predetermined plan of the one who guides all things as he decides by his own
    will; chosen to be, for his greater glory, the people who would put their
    hopes in Christ before he came. Now you too, in him, have heard the message
    of the truth and the good news of your salvation, and have believed it; and
    you too have been stamped with the seal of the Holy Spirit of the Promise
    the pledge of our inheritance which brings freedom for those whom God has
    taken for his own, to make his glory praised.

    Mary set out at that time and went as quickly as she could to a town in the
    hill country of Judah. She went into Zechariah's house and greeted
    Elizabeth. Now as soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child leapt
    in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. She gave a loud
    cry and said, 'Of all women you are the most blessed, and blessed is the
    fruit of your womb. Why should I be honoured with a visit from the mother of
    my Lord? For the moment your greeting reached my ears, the child in my womb
    leapt for joy. Yes, blessed is she who believed that the promise made her by
    the Lord would be fulfilled.' And Mary said: 'My soul proclaims the
    greatness of the Lord and my spirit exults in God my saviour; because he has
    looked upon his lowly handmaid. Yes, from this day forward all generations
    will call me blessed, for the Almighty has done great things for me. Holy is
    his name, and his mercy reaches from age to age for those who fear him. He
    has shown the power of his arm, he has routed the proud of heart. He has
    pulled down princes from their thrones and exalted the lowly. The hungry he
    has filled with good things, the rich sent empty away. He has come to the
    help of Israel his servant, mindful of his mercy -according to the promise
    he made to our ancestors-of his mercy to Abraham and to his descendants for
    ever.'

  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    King Herod started persecuting certain members of the Church. He beheaded
    James the brother of John, and when he saw that this pleased the Jews he
    decided to arrest Peter as well. This was during the days of Unleavened
    Bread, and he put Peter in prison, assigning four squads of four soldiers
    each to guard him in turns. Herod meant to try Peter in public after the end
    of Passover week. All the time Peter was under guard the Church prayed to
    God for him unremittingly. On the night before Herod was to try him, Peter
    was sleeping between two soldiers, fastened with double chains, while guards
    kept watch at the main entrance to the prison. Then suddenly the angel of
    the Lord stood there, and the cell was filled with light. He tapped Peter on
    the side and woke him. 'Get up!' he said 'Hurry!' - and the chains fell from
    his hands. The angel then said, 'Put on your belt and sandals'. After he had
    done this, the angel next said, 'Wrap your cloak round you and follow me'.
    Peter followed him, but had no idea that what the angel did was all
    happening in reality; he thought he was seeing a vision. They passed through
    two guard posts one after the other, and reached the iron gate leading to
    the city. This opened of its own accord; they went through it and had walked
    the whole length of one street when suddenly the angel left him. It was only
    then that Peter came to himself. 'Now I know it is all true' he said. The
    Lord really did send his angel and has saved me from Herod and from all that
    the Jewish people were so certain would happen to me.'

    When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi he put this question to
    his disciples, 'Who do people say the Son of Man is?' And they said, 'Some
    say he is John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the
    prophets'. 'But you,' he said 'who do you say I am?' Then Simon Peter spoke
    up, 'You are the Christ,' he said 'the Son of the living God'. Jesus
    replied, 'Simon son of Jonah, you are a happy man! Because it was not flesh
    and blood that revealed this to you but my Father in heaven. So I now say to
    you: You are Peter and on this rock I will build my Church. And the gates of

    Jesus said: I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd is one who lays down
    his life for his sheep. 10:12The hired man, since he is not the shepherd and
    the sheep do not belong to him, abandons the sheep and runs away as soon as
    he sees a wolf coming, and then the wolf attacks and scatters the sheep;
    this is because he is only a hired man and has no concern for the sheep. I
    am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me, 10:15just as the
    Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for my sheep.
    10:16And there are other sheep I have that are not of this fold, and these I
    have to lead as well. They too will listen to my voice, and there will be
    only one flock, and one shepherd.

    Blessed be God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with
    all the spiritual blessings of heaven in Christ. Before the world was made,
    he chose us, chose us in Christ, to be holy and spotless, and to live
    through love in his presence, determining that we should become his adopted
    sons, through Jesus Christ for his own kind purposes, to make us praise the
    glory of his grace, his free gift to us in the Beloved, in whom, through his
    blood, we gain our freedom, the forgiveness of our sins. Such is the
    richness of the grace which he has showered on us in all wisdom and insight.
    He has let us know the mystery of his purpose, the hidden plan he so kindly
    made in Christ from the beginning to act upon when the times had run their
    course to the end: that he would bring everything together under Christ, as
    head, everything in the heavens and everything on earth. And it is in him
    that we were claimed as God's own, chosen from the beginning, under the
    predetermined plan of the one who guides all things as he decides by his own
    will; chosen to be, for his greater glory, the people who would put their
    hopes in Christ before he came. Now you too, in him, have heard the message
    of the truth and the good news of your salvation, and have believed it; and
    you too have been stamped with the seal of the Holy Spirit of the Promise
    the pledge of our inheritance which brings freedom for those whom God has
    taken for his own, to make his glory praised.

    Mary set out at that time and went as quickly as she could to a town in the
    hill country of Judah. She went into Zechariah's house and greeted
    Elizabeth. Now as soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child leapt
    in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. She gave a loud
    cry and said, 'Of all women you are the most blessed, and blessed is the
    fruit of your womb. Why should I be honoured with a visit from the mother of
    my Lord? For the moment your greeting reached my ears, the child in my womb
    leapt for joy. Yes, blessed is she who believed that the promise made her by
    the Lord would be fulfilled.' And Mary said: 'My soul proclaims the
    greatness of the Lord and my spirit exults in God my saviour; because he has
    looked upon his lowly handmaid. Yes, from this day forward all generations
    will call me blessed, for the Almighty has done great things for me. Holy is
    his name, and his mercy reaches from age to age for those who fear him. He
    has shown the power of his arm, he has routed the proud of heart. He has
    pulled down princes from their thrones and exalted the lowly. The hungry he
    has filled with good things, the rich sent empty away. He has come to the
    help of Israel his servant, mindful of his mercy -according to the promise
    he made to our ancestors-of his mercy to Abraham and to his descendants for
    ever.'
