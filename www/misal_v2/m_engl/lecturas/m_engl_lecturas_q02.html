    Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a
    high mountain where they could be alone. There in their presence he was
    transfigured: his face shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as
    the light. Suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared to them; they were talking
    with him. Then Peter spoke to Jesus. 'Lord,' he said 'it is wonderful for us
    to be here; if you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for
    Moses and one for Elijah.' He was still speaking when suddenly a bright
    cloud covered them with shadow, and from the cloud there came a voice which
    said, 'This is my Son, the Beloved; he enjoys my favour. Listen to him.'
    When they heard this the disciples fell on their faces overcome with fear.
    But Jesus came up and touched them. 'Stand up,' he said 'do not be afraid.'
    And when they raised their eyes they saw no one but only Jesus. As they came
    down from the mountain Jesus gave them this order, 'Tell no one about the
    vision until the Son of Man has risen from the dead'.

    God put Abraham to the test. 'Abraham, Abraham' he called. 'Here I am' he
    replied. 'Take your son,' God said 'your only child Isaac, whom you love,
    and go to the land of Moriah. There you shall offer him as a burnt offering,
    on a mountain I will point out to you.' When they arrived at the place God
    had pointed out to him, Abraham built an altar there, and arranged the wood.
    Then he stretched out his hand and seized the knife to kill his son. But the
    angel of the Lord called to him from heaven. 'Abraham, Abraham' he said. 'I
    am here' he replied. 'Do not raise your hand against the boy' the angel
    said. 'Do not harm him, for now I know you fear God. You have not refused me
    your son, your only son.' Then looking up, Abraham saw a ram caught by its
    horns in a bush. Abraham took the ram and offered it as a burnt-offering in
    place of his son. The angel of the Lord called Abraham a second time from
    heaven. 'I swear by my own self - it is the Lord who speaks - because you
    have done this, because you have not refused me your son, your only son, I
    will shower blessings on you, I will make your descendants as many as the
    stars of heaven and the grains of sand on the seashore. Your descendants
    shall gain possession of the gates of their enemies. All the nations of the

    Jesus took with him Peter and James and John and led them up a high mountain
    where they could be alone by themselves. There in their presence he was
    transfigured: his clothes became dazzlingly white, whiter than any earthly
    bleacher could make them. Elijah appeared to them with Moses; and they were
    talking with Jesus. Then Peter spoke to Jesus: 'Rabbi,' he said 'it is
    wonderful for us to be here; so let us make three tents, one for you, one
    for Moses and one for Elijah'. He did not know what to say; they were so
    frightened. And a cloud came, covering them in shadow; and there came a
    voice from the cloud, 'This is my Son, the Beloved. Listen to him.' Then
    suddenly, when they looked round, they saw no one with them any more but
    only Jesus. As they came down from the mountain he warned them to tell no
    one what they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
    They observed the warning faithfully, though among themselves they discussed
    what 'rising from the dead' could mean.

    Taking Abram outside the Lord said, 'Look up to heaven and count the stars

    in the Lord, who counted this as making him justified. 'I am the Lord he
    said to him 'who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldaeans to make you heir to
    this land.' 'My Lord,' Abram replied 'how am I to know that I shall inherit
    it?' He said to him, 'Get me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old goat,
    a three-year-old ram, a turtledove and a young pigeon.' He brought him all
    these, cut them in half and put half on one side and half facing it on the
    other; but the birds he did not cut in half. Birds of prey came down on the

    Jesus took with him Peter and John and James and went up the mountain to
    pray. As he prayed, the aspect of his face was changed and his clothing
    became brilliant as lightning. Suddenly there were two men there talking to
    him; they were Moses and Elijah appearing in glory, and they were speaking
    of his passing which he was to accomplish in Jerusalem. Peter and his
    companions were heavy with sleep, but they kept awake and saw his glory and
    the two men standing with him. As these were leaving him, Peter said to
    Jesus, 'Master, it is wonderful for us to be here; so let us make three
    tents, one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah'. - He did not know
    what he was saying. As he spoke, a cloud came and covered them with shadow;
    and when they went into the cloud the disciples were afraid. And a voice
    came from the cloud saying, 'This is my Son, the Chosen One. Listen to him.'
    And after the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. The disciples kept
    silence and, at that time, told no one what they had seen.

    Addressing the people and his disciples Jesus said, &nbsp;'The scribes and
    the Pharisees occupy the chair of Moses. &nbsp;You must therefore do what
    they tell you and listen to what they say; but do not be guided by what they
    do: since they do not practise what they preach. &nbsp;They tie up heavy
    burdens and lay them on men's shoulders, but will they lift a finger to move
    them? Not they! &nbsp;Everything they do is done to attract attention, like
    wearing broader phylacteries and longer tassels, &nbsp;like wanting to take
    the place of honour at banquets and the front seats in the synagogues,
    &nbsp;being greeted obsequiously in the market squares and having people
    call them Rabbi. &nbsp;'You, however, must not allow yourselves to be called
    Rabbi, since you have only one master, and you are all brothers. &nbsp;You
    must call no one on earth your father, since you have only one Father, and
    he is in heaven. &nbsp;Nor must you allow yourselves to be called teachers,
    for you have only one Teacher, the Christ. &nbsp;The greatest among you must
    be your servant. &nbsp;Anyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and anyone
    who humbles himself will exalted.

    Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, and on the way he took the Twelve to one
    side and said to them, 'Now we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man
    is about to be handed over to the chief priests and scribes. They will
    condemn him to death and will hand him over to the pagans to be mocked and
    scourged and crucified; and on the third day he will rise again.' Then the
    mother of Zebedee's sons came with her sons to make a request of him, and
    bowed low; and he said to her, 'What is it you want?' She said to him,
    'Promise that these two sons of mine may sit one at your right hand and the
    other at your left in your kingdom'. 'You do not know what you are asking'
    Jesus answered. 'Can you drink the cup that I am going to drink?' They
    replied, 'We can'. 'Very well,' he said 'you shall drink my cup, but as for
    seats at my right hand and my left, these are not mine to grant; they belong
    to those to whom they have been allotted by my Father.' When the other ten
    heard this they were indignant with the two brothers. But Jesus called them
    to him and said, 'You know that among the pagans the rulers lord it over
    them, and their great men make their authority felt. This is not to happen
    among you. No; anyone who wants to be great among you must be your servant,
    and anyone who wants to be first among you must be your slave, just as the
    Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a
    ransom for many.'

    Jesus said to the Pharisees: 'There was a rich man who used to dress in
    purple and fine linen and feast magnificently every day. &nbsp;And at his
    gate there lay a poor man called Lazarus, covered with sores, &nbsp;who
    longed to fill himself with the scraps that fell from the rich man's table.
    Dogs even came and licked his sores. &nbsp;Now the poor man died and was
    carried away by the angels to the bosom of Abraham. The rich man also died
    and was buried. &nbsp;'In his torment in Hades he looked up and saw Abraham
    a long way off with Lazarus in his bosom. &nbsp;So he cried out, "Father
    Abraham, pity me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and
    cool my tongue, for I am in agony in these flames". &nbsp;"My son," Abraham
    replied "remember that during your life good things came your way, just as
    bad things came the way of Lazarus. Now he is being comforted here while you
    are in agony. &nbsp;But that is not all: between us and you a great gulf has
    been fixed, to stop anyone, if he wanted to, crossing from our side to
    yours, and to stop any crossing from your side to ours." &nbsp;'The rich man
    replied, "Father, I beg you then to send Lazarus to my father's house,
    &nbsp;since I have five brothers, to give them warning so that they do not
    come to this place of torment too". &nbsp;"They have Moses and the
    prophets," said Abraham "let them listen to them.". &nbsp;"Ah no, father
    Abraham," said the rich man "but if someone comes to them from the dead,
    they will repent." &nbsp;Then Abraham said to him, "If they will not listen
    either to Moses or to the prophets, they will not be convinced even if
    someone should rise from the dead".'

    Israel loved Joseph more than all his other sons, for he was the son of his
    old age, and he had a coat with long sleeves made for him. But his brothers,
    seeing how his father loved him more than all his other sons, came to hate
    him so much that they could not say a civil word to him. His brothers went
    to pasture their father's flock at Shechem. Then Israel said to Joseph, 'Are
    not your brothers with the flock at Shechem? Come, I am going to send you to
    them.' So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan. They saw
    him in the distance, and before he reached them they made a plot among
    themselves to put him to death. 'Here comes the man of dreams' they said to
    one another. 'Come on, let us kill him and throw him into some well; we can
    say that a wild beast devoured him. Then we shall see what becomes of his
    dreams.' But Reuben heard, and he saved him from their violence. 'We must
    not take his life' he said. 'Shed no blood,' said Reuben to them 'throw him
    into this well in the wilderness, but do not lay violent hands on him' -
    intending to save him from them and to restore him to his father. So, when
    Joseph reached his brothers, they pulled off his coat, the coat with long
    sleeves that he was wearing, and catching hold of him they threw him into
    the well, an empty well with no water in it. They then sat down to eat.
    Looking up they saw a group of Ishmaelites who were coming from Gilead,
    their camels laden with gum, tragacanth, balsam and resin, which they were
    taking down into Egypt. Then Judah said to his brothers, 'What do we gain by
    killing our brother and covering up his blood? Come, let us sell him to the
    Ishmaelites, but let us not do any harm to him. After all, he is our
    brother, and our own flesh.' His brothers agreed. Now some Midianite
    merchants were passing, and they drew Joseph up out of the well. They sold
    Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty silver pieces, and these men took
    Joseph to Egypt.

    Jesus said to the chief priests and the elders of the people: 'Listen to
    another parable. There was a man, a landowner, who planted a vineyard; he
    fenced it round, dug a winepress in it and built a tower; then he leased it
    to tenants and went abroad. When vintage time drew near he sent his servants
    to the tenants to collect his produce. But the tenants seized his servants,
    thrashed one, killed another and stoned a third. Next he sent some more
    servants, this time a larger number, and they dealt with them in the same
    way. Finally he sent his son to them. "They will respect my son" he said.
    But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, "This is the
    heir. Come on, let us kill him and take over his inheritance." So they
    seized him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. Now when the
    owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?' They
    answered, 'He will bring those wretches to a wretched end and lease the
    vineyard to other tenants who will deliver the produce to him when the
    season arrives'. Jesus said to them, 'Have you never read in the scriptures:
    It was the stone rejected by the builders that became the keystone. This was
    the Lord's doing and it is wonderful to see? I tell you, then, that the
    kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will produce
    its fruit.' When they heard his parables, the chief priests and the scribes
    realised he was speaking about them, but though they would have liked to
    arrest him they were afraid of the crowds, who looked on him as a prophet.

    The tax collectors and the sinners, meanwhile, were all seeking his company
    to hear what he had to say, and the Pharisees and the scribes complained.
    'This man' they said 'welcomes sinners and eats with them.' So he spoke this
    parable to them: 'A man had two sons. The younger said to his father,
    "Father, let me have the share of the estate that would come to me". So the
    father divided the property between them. A few days later, the younger son
    got together everything he had and left for a distant country where he
    squandered his money on a life of debauchery. 'When he had spent it all,
    that country experienced a severe famine, and now he began to feel the
    pinch, so he hired himself out to one of the local inhabitants who put him
    on his farm to feed the pigs. And he would willingly have filled his belly
    with the husks the pigs were eating but no one offered him anything. Then he
    came to his senses and said, "How many of my father's paid servants have
    more food than they want, and here am I dying of hunger! I will leave this
    place and go to my father and say: Father, I have sinned against heaven and
    against you; I no longer deserve to be called your son; treat me as one of
    your paid servants." So he left the place and went back to his father.
    'While he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with
    pity. He ran to the boy, clasped him in his arms and kissed him tenderly.
    Then his son said, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I
    no longer deserve to be called your son." But the father said to his
    servants, "Quick! Bring out the best robe and put it on him; put a ring on
    his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the calf we have been fattening,
    and kill it; we are going to have a feast, a celebration, because this son
    of mine was dead and has come back to life; he was lost and is found." And
    they began to celebrate. 'Now the elder son was out in the fields, and on
    his way back, as he drew near the house, he could hear music and dancing.
    Calling one of the servants he asked what it was all about. "Your brother
    has come" replied the servant "and your father has killed the calf we had
    fattened because he has got him back safe and sound." He was angry then and
    refused to go in, and his father came out to plead with him; but he answered
    his father, "Look, all these years I have slaved for you and never once
    disobeyed your orders, yet you never offered me so much as a kid for me to
    celebrate with my friends. But, for this son of yours, when he comes back
    after swallowing up your property - he and his women - you kill the calf we
    had been fattening." The father said, "My son, you are with me always and
    all I have is yours. But it was only right we should celebrate and rejoice,
    because your brother here was dead and has come to life; he was lost and is
    found."'
