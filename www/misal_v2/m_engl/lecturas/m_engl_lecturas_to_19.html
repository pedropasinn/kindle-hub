    When Elijah reached Horeb, the mountain of God, he went into the cave and
    spent the night in it. Then he was told, 'Go out and stand on the mountain
    before the Lord'. Then the Lord himself went by. There came a mighty wind,
    so strong it tore the mountains and shattered the rocks before the Lord. But
    the Lord was not in the wind. After the wind came an earthquake. But the
    Lord was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake came a fire. But the
    Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire there came the sound of a
    gentle breeze. And when Elijah heard this, he covered his face with his
    cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave.

    What I want to say now is no pretence; I say it in union with Christ - it is
    the truth - my conscience in union with the Holy Spirit assures me of it
    too. What I want to say is this: my sorrow is so great, my mental anguish so
    endless, I would willingly be condemned and be cut off from Christ if it
    could help my brothers of Israel, my own flesh and blood. They were adopted
    as sons, they were given the glory and the covenants; the Law and the ritual
    were drawn up for them, and the promises were made to them. They are

    is above all, God for ever blessed! Amen.

    After having fed the crowds, Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and
    go on ahead to the other side while he would send the crowds away. After
    sending the crowds away he went up into the hills by himself to pray. When
    evening came, he was there alone, while the boat, by now far out on the
    lake, was battling with a heavy sea, for there was a head-wind. In the
    fourth watch of the night he went towards them, walking on the lake, and
    when the disciples saw him walking on the lake they were terrified. 'It is a
    ghost' they said, and cried out in fear. But at once Jesus called out to
    them, saying, 'Courage! It is I! Do not be afraid.' lt was Peter who
    answered. 'Lord,' he said 'if it is you, tell me to come to you across the
    water.' 'Come' said Jesus. Then Peter got out of the boat and started
    walking towards Jesus across the water, but as soon as he felt the force of
    the wind, he took fright and began to sink. 'Lord! Save me!' he cried. Jesus
    put out his hand at once and held him. 'Man of little faith,' he said 'why
    did you doubt?' And as they got into the boat the wind dropped.14:33 The men
    in the boat bowed down before him and said, 'Truly, you are the Son of God'.

    Elijah went on into the wilderness, a day's journey, and sitting under a
    furze bush wished he were dead. 'Lord,' he said 'I have had enough. Take my
    life; I am no better than my ancestors.' Then he lay down and went to sleep.
    But an angel touched him and said, 'Get up and eat'. He looked round, and
    there at his head was a scone baked on hot stones, and a jar of water. He
    ate and drank and then lay down again. But the angel of the Lord came back a
    second time and touched him and said, 'Get up and eat, or the journey will
    be too long for you'. So he got up and ate and drank, and strengthened by
    that food he walked for forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb,
    the mountain of God.

    The Jews were complaining to each other about Jesus, because he had said, 'I
    am the bread that came down from heaven'. 'Surely this is Jesus son of
    Joseph' they said. 'We know his father and mother. How can he now say, "I
    have come down from heaven"?' Jesus said in reply, 'Stop complaining to each
    other. 'No one can come to me unless he is drawn by the Father who sent me,
    and I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the prophets: They
    will all be taught by God, and to hear the teaching of the Father, and learn
    from it, is to come to me. Not that anybody has seen the Father, except the
    one who comes from God: he has seen the Father. I tell you most solemnly,
    everybody who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your
    fathers ate the manna in the desert and they are dead; but this is the bread
    that comes down from heaven, so that a man may eat it and not die. I am the
    living bread which has come down from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread
    will live for ever; and the bread that I shall give is my flesh, for the
    life of the world.'

    Only faith can guarantee the blessings that we hope for, or prove the
    existence of the realities that at present remain unseen. It was for faith
    that our ancestors were commended. It was by faith that Abraham obeyed the
    call to set out for a country that was the inheritance given to him and his
    descendants, and that he set out without knowing where he was going. By
    faith he arrived, as a foreigner, in the Promised Land, and lived there as
    if in a strange country, with Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of
    the same promise. They lived there in tents while he looked forward to a
    city founded, designed and built by God. It was equally by faith that Sarah,
    in spite of being past the age, was made able to conceive, because she
    believed that he who had made the promise would be faithful to it. Because
    of this, there came from one man, and one who was already as good as dead
    himself, more descendants than could be counted, as many as the stars of
    heaven or the grains of sand on the seashore. All these died in faith,
    before receiving any of the things that had been promised, but they saw them
    in the far distance and welcomed them, recognizing that they were only
    strangers and nomads on earth. People who use such terms about themselves
    make it quite plain that they are in search of their real homeland. They can
    hardly have meant the country they came from, since they had the opportunity
    to go back to it; but in fact they were longing for a better homeland, their
    heavenly homeland. That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God,
    since he has founded the city for them. It was by faith that Abraham, when
    put to the test, offered up Isaac. He offered to sacrifice his only son even
    though the promises had been made to him and he had been told: It is through
    Isaac that your name will be carried on. He was confident that God had the
    power even to raise the dead; and so, figuratively speaking, he was given
    back Isaac from the dead.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'There is no need to be afraid, little flock,
    for it has pleased your Father to give you the kingdom. 'Sell your
    possessions and give alms. Get yourselves purses that do not wear out,
    treasure that will not fail you, in heaven where no thief can reach it and
    no moth destroy it. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be
    also. 'See that you are dressed for action and have your lamps lit. Be like
    men waiting for their master to return from the wedding feast, ready to open
    the door as soon as he comes and knocks. Happy those servants whom the
    master finds awake when he comes. I tell you solemnly, he will put on an
    apron, sit them down at table and wait on them. It may be in the second
    watch he comes, or in the third, but happy those servants if he finds them
    ready. You may be quite sure of this, that if the householder had known at
    what hour the burglar would come, he would not have let anyone break through
    the wall of his house. You too must stand ready, because the Son of Man is
    coming at an hour you do not expect.' Peter said, 'Lord, do you mean this
    parable for us, or for everyone?' The Lord replied, 'What sort of steward,
    then, is faithful and wise enough for the master to place him over his
    household to give them their allowance of food at the proper time? Happy
    that servant if his master's arrival finds him at this employment. I tell
    you truly, he will place him over everything he owns. But as for the servant
    who says to himself, "My master is taking his time coming", and sets about
    beating the menservants and the maids, and eating and drinking and getting
    drunk, his master will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he
    does not know. The master will cut him off and send him to the same fate as
    the unfaithful. The servant who knows what his master wants, but has not
    even started to carry out those wishes, will receive very many strokes of
    the lash. The one who did not know, but deserves to be beaten for what he
    has done, will receive fewer strokes. When a man has had a great deal given
    him, a great deal will be demanded of him; when a man has had a great deal
    given him on trust, even more will be expected of him.

    their descendants, you yourselves, up to the present day. Circumcise your
    heart then and be obstinate no longer; for the Lord your God is God of gods
    and Lord of lords, the great God, triumphant and terrible, never partial,
    never to be bribed. It is he who sees justice done for the orphan and the
    widow, who loves the stranger and gives him food and clothing. Love the
    stranger then, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. It is the Lord
    your God you must fear and serve; you must cling to him; in his name take
    your oaths. He it is you must praise, he is your God: for you he has done
    these great and terrible things you have seen with your own eyes; and though
    your fathers numbered only seventy when they went down to Egypt, the Lord
    your God has made you as many as the stars of heaven.

    On the fifth of the month - it was the fifth year of exile for King&nbsp;
    Jehoiachin - the word of the Lord was addressed to the priest Ezekiel son of
    Buzi, in the land of the Chaldaeans, on the bank of the river Chebar. There
    the hand of the Lord came on me. I looked; a stormy wind blew from the
    north, a great cloud with light around it, a fire from which flashes of
    lightning darted, and in the centre a sheen like bronze at the heart of the
    fire. In the centre I saw what seemed four animals. They looked like this.
    They were of human form. Each had four faces, each had four wings. I heard
    the noise of their wings as they moved; it sounded like rushing water, like
    the voice of Shaddai, a noise like a storm, like the noise of a camp; when
    they halted, they folded their wings, and there was a noise. Above the vault
    over their heads was something that looked like a sapphire; it was shaped
    like a throne and high up on this throne was a being that looked like a man.
    I saw him shine like bronze, and close to and all around him from what
    seemed his loins upwards was what looked like fire; and from what seemed his
    loins downwards I saw what looked like fire, and a light all round like a
    bow in the clouds on rainy days; that is how the surrounding light appeared.
    It was something that looked like the glory of the Lord. I looked, and
    prostrated myself.

    One day when they were together in Galilee, Jesus said to his disciples,
    'The Son of Man is going to be handed over into the power of men; they will
    put him to death, and on the third day he will be raised to life again'. And
    a great sadness came over them. When they reached Capernaum, the collectors
    of the half shekel came to Peter and said, 'Does your master not pay the
    half-shekel?' 'Oh yes' he replied, and went into the house. But before he
    could speak, Jesus said, 'Simon, what is your opinion? From whom do the
    kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their sons or from
    foreigners?' And when he replied, 'From foreigners', Jesus said, 'Well then,
    the sons are exempt. However, so as not to offend these people, go to the
    lake and cast a hook; take the first fish that bites, open its mouth and
    there you will find a shekel; take it and give it to them for me and for
    you.'

    Moses proceeded to address these words to the whole of Israel, 'I am one

    The Lord has said to me, "You shall not cross this Jordan ". It is the Lord

    At this time the disciples came to Jesus and said, 'Who is the greatest in

    in front of them. Then he said, 'I tell you solemnly, unless you change and
    become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. And
    so, the one who makes himself as little as this little child is the greatest
    in the kingdom of heaven. 'Anyone who welcomes a little child like this in
    my name welcomes me. 'See that you never despise any of these little ones,
    for I tell you that their angels in heaven are continually in the presence

    Leaving the plains of Moab, Moses went up Mount Nebo, the peak of Pisgah
    opposite Jericho, and the Lord showed him the whole land; Gilead as far as
    Dan, all Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah
    as far as the Western Sea, the Negeb, and the stretch of the Valley of
    Jericho, city of palm trees, as far as Zoar. The Lord said to him, 'This is
    the land I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying: I will give it
    to your descendants. I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you shall
    not cross into it.' There in the land of Moab, Moses the servant of the Lord
    died as the Lord decreed; he buried him in the valley, in the land of Moab,
    opposite Beth-peor; but to this day no one has ever found his grave. Moses
    was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, his eye undimmed, his
    vigour unimpaired. The sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab
    for thirty days. The days of weeping for the mourning rites of Moses came to
    an end. Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses
    had laid his hands on him. It was he that the sons of Israel obeyed,
    carrying out the order that the Lord had given to Moses. Since then, never
    has there been such a prophet in Israel as Moses, the man the Lord knew face
    to face. What signs and wonders the Lord caused him to perform in the land
    of Egypt against Pharaoh and all his servants and his whole land! How mighty
    the hand and great the fear that Moses wielded in the sight of all Israel!

    As I listened God shouted, 'Come here, you scourges of the city, and bring
    your weapons of destruction'. Immediately six men advanced from the upper
    north gate, each holding a deadly weapon. In the middle of them was a man in
    white, with a scribe's ink horn in his belt. They came in and halted in
    front of the bronze altar. The glory of the God of Israel rose off the
    cherubs where it had been and went up to the threshold of the Temple. He
    called the man in white with a scribe's ink horn in his belt and said, 'Go
    all through the city, all through Jerusalem, and mark a cross on the
    foreheads of all who deplore and disapprove of all the filth practised in
    it'. I heard him say to the others, 'Follow him through the city, and
    strike. Show neither pity nor mercy; old men, young men, virgins, children,
    women, kill and exterminate them all. But do not touch anyone with a cross
    on his forehead. Begin at my sanctuary.' So they began with the old men in
    front of the Temple. He said to them, 'Defile the Temple; fill the courts
    with corpses, and go'. They went out and hacked their way through the city.
    The glory of the Lord came out from the Temple threshold and paused over the
    cherubs. The cherubs spread their wings and rose from the ground to leave,
    and as I watched the wheels rose with them. They paused at the entrance to
    the east gate of the Temple of the Lord, and the glory of the God of Israel
    hovered over them. This was the creature that I had seen supporting the God
    of Israel beside the river Chebar, and I was now certain that these were
    cherubs. Each had four faces and four wings and what seemed to be human
    hands under their wings. Their faces were just as I had seen them beside the
    river Chebar. Each moved straight forward.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'If your brother does something wrong, go and
    have it out with him alone, between your two selves. If he listens to you,
    you have won back your brother. &nbsp;If he does not listen, take one or two
    others along with you: the evidence of two or three witnesses is required to

  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    The Lord said to Joshua, 'This very day I will begin to make you a great man
    in the eyes of all Israel, to let them be sure that I am going to be with
    you even as I was with Moses. As for you, give this order to the priests
    carrying the ark of the covenant: "When you have reached the brink of the
    waters of the Jordan, you are to stand still in the Jordan itself". Then
    Joshua said to the Israelites, 'Come closer and hear the words of the Lord
    your God'. Joshua said, 'By this you shall know that a living God is with
    you and without a doubt will expel the Canaanite. Look, the ark of the Lord,
    the Lord of the whole earth, is about to cross the Jordan at your head. 'As
    soon as the priests with the ark of the Lord, the Lord of the whole earth,
    have set their feet in the waters of the Jordan, the upper waters of the
    Jordan flowing down will be stopped in their course and stand still in one
    mass.' Accordingly, when the people struck camp to cross the Jordan, the
    priests carried the ark of the covenant in front of the people. As soon as
    the bearers of the ark reached the Jordan and the feet of the priests who
    carried it touched the waters (the Jordan overflows the whole length of its
    banks throughout the harvest season) the upper waters stood still and made
    one heap over a wide space - from Adam to the fortress of Zarethan - while
    those flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah, that is, the Salt Sea, stopped
    running altogether. The people crossed opposite Jericho. The priests who
    carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood still on dry ground in
    mid-Jordan, and all Israel continued to cross dry-shod till the whole nation
    had finished its crossing of the river.

    Peter went up to Jesus and said, 'Lord, how often must I forgive my brother
    if he wrongs me? As often as seven times?' Jesus answered, 'Not seven, I
    tell you, but seventy-seven times. 'And so the kingdom of heaven may be
    compared to a king who decided to settle his accounts with his servants.
    When the reckoning began, they brought him a man who owed ten thousand
    talents; but he had no means of paying, so his master gave orders that he
    should be sold, together with his wife and children and all his possessions,
    to meet the debt. At this, the servant threw himself down at his master's
    feet. "Give me time" he said "and I will pay the whole sum." And the
    servant's master felt so sorry for him that he let him go and cancelled the
    debt. Now as this servant went out, he happened to meet a fellow servant who
    owed him one hundred denarii; and he seized him by the throat and began to
    throttle him. "Pay what you owe me" he said. His fellow servant fell at his
    feet and implored him, saying, "Give me time and I will pay you". But the
    other would not agree; on the contrary, he had him thrown into prison till
    he should pay the debt. His fellow servants were deeply distressed when they
    saw what had happened, and they went to their master and reported the whole
    affair to him. Then the master sent for him. "You wicked servant," he said
    "I cancelled all that debt of yours when you appealed to me. Were you not
    bound, then, to have pity on your fellow servant just as I had pity on you?"
    And in his anger the master handed him over to the torturers till he should
    pay all his debt. And that is how my heavenly Father will deal with you
    unless you each forgive your brother from your heart.' Jesus had now
    finished what he wanted to say, and he left Galilee and came into the part
    of Judaea which is on the far side of the Jordan.

  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel together at Shechem; then he called
    the elders, leaders, judges and scribes of Israel, and they presented
    themselves before God. Then Joshua said to all the people: 'The Lord the God
    of Israel says this, "In ancient days your ancestors lived beyond the River
    - such was Terah the father of Abraham and of Nahor - and they served other
    gods. Then I brought your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him
    through all the land of Canaan. I increased his descendants and gave him
    Isaac. To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave the mountain country
    of Seir as his possession. Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt. Then I
    sent Moses and Aaron and plagued Egypt with the wonders that I worked there.
    So I brought you out of it. I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, and you
    came to the Sea; the Egyptians pursued your ancestors with chariots and
    horsemen as far as the Sea of Reeds. There they called to the Lord, and he
    spread a thick fog between you and the Egyptians, and made the sea go back
    on them and cover them. You saw with your own eyes the things I did in
    Egypt. Then for a long time you lived in the wilderness, until I brought you
    into the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan; they made war on
    you and I gave them into your hands; you took possession of their country
    because I destroyed them before you. Next, Balak son of Zippor the king of
    Moab arose to make war on Israel, and sent for Balaam son of Beor to come
    and curse you. But I would not listen to Balaam; instead, he had to bless
    you, and I saved you from his hand. "When you crossed the Jordan and came to
    Jericho, those who held Jericho fought against you, as did the Amorites and
    Perizzites, the Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and Jebusites,
    but I put them all into your power. I sent out hornets in front of you,
    which drove the two Amorite kings before you; this was not the work of your
    sword or your bow. I gave you a land where you never toiled, you live in
    towns you never built; you eat now from vineyards and olive groves you never
    planted."

    The word of the Lord was addressed to me as follows, 'Son of man, confront

    birth you belong to the land of Canaan. Your father was an Amorite and your
    mother a Hittite. At birth, the very day you were born, there was no one to
    cut your navel-string, or wash you in cleansing water, or rub you with salt,
    or wrap you in napkins. No one leaned kindly over you to do anything like
    that for you. You were exposed in the open fields; you were as unloved as
    that on the day you were born. I saw you struggling in your blood as I was
    passing, and I said to you as you lay in your blood: Live, and grow like the
    grass of the fields. You developed, you grew, you reached marriageable age.
    Your breasts and your hair both grew, but you were quite naked. Then I saw
    you as I was passing. Your time had come, the time for love. I spread part
    of my cloak over you and covered your nakedness; I bound myself by oath, I
    made a covenant with you - it is the Lord who speaks - and you became mine.
    I bathed you in water, I washed the blood off you, I anointed you with oil.
    I gave you embroidered dresses, fine leather shoes, a linen headband and a
    cloak of silk. I loaded you with jewels, gave you bracelets for your wrists
    and a necklace for your throat. I gave you nose-ring and earrings; I put a
    beautiful diadem on your head. You were loaded with gold and silver, and
    dressed in fine linen and embroidered silks. Your food was the finest flour,
    honey and oil. You grew more and more beautiful; and you rose to be queen.
    The fame of your beauty spread through the nations, since it was perfect,
    because I had clothed you with my own splendour - it is the Lord who speaks.
    You have become infatuated with your own beauty; you have used your fame to
    make yourself a prostitute; you have offered your services to all comers.
    But I will remember the covenant that I made with you when you were a girl,
    and I will conclude a covenant with you that shall last for ever. So
    remember and be covered with shame, and in your confusion be reduced to
    silence, when I have pardoned you for all that you have done - it is the

    Some Pharisees approached Jesus, and to test him they said, 'Is it against
    the Law for a man to divorce his wife on any pretext whatever?' He answered,
    'Have you not read that the creator from the beginning made them male and
    female and that he said: This is why a man must leave father and mother, and
    cling to his wife, and the two become one body? They are no longer two,
    therefore, but one body. So then, what God has united, man must not divide'.
    They said to him, 'Then why did Moses command that a writ of dismissal
    should be given in cases of divorce?' 'It was because you were so
    unteachable' he said 'that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but it
    was not like this from the beginning. Now I say this to you: the man who
    divorces his wife - I am not speaking of fornication - and marries another,
    is guilty of adultery.' The disciples said to him, 'If that is how things
    are between husband and wife, it is not advisable to marry'. But he replied,
    'It is not everyone who can accept what I have said, but only those to whom
    it is granted. There are eunuchs born that way from their mother's womb,
    there are eunuchs made so by men and there are eunuchs who have made
    themselves that way for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept
    this who can.'

    A reading from the&nbsp;Book of Joshua<span class="alindcha">24:14-29</span>
  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    Joshua said to all the people: 'So now, fear the Lord and serve him
    perfectly and sincerely; put away the gods that your ancestors served beyond
    the River and in Egypt, and serve the Lord.But if you will not serve the
    Lord, choose today whom you wish to serve, whether the gods that your
    ancestors served beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land
    you are now living. As for me and my House, we will serve the Lord.' The
    people answered, 'We have no intention of deserting the Lord and serving
    other gods! Was it not the Lord our God who brought us and our ancestors out
    of the land of Egypt, the house of slavery, who worked those great wonders
    before our eyes and preserved us all along the way we travelled and among
    all the peoples through whom we journeyed?What is more, the Lord drove all
    those peoples out before us, as well as the Amorites who used to live in
    this country. We too will serve the Lord, for he is our God.' Then Joshua
    said to the people, 'You cannot serve the Lord, because he is a holy God, he
    is a jealous God who will not forgive your transgressions or your sins. If
    you desert the Lord to follow alien gods he in turn will afflict and destroy
    you after the goodness he has shown you.' The people answered Joshua, 'No;
    it is the Lord we wish to serve'. Then Joshua said to the people, 'You are
    witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the Lord, to serve him'.
    They answered, 'We are witnesses'. 'Then cast away the alien gods among you
    and give your hearts to the Lord the God of Israel!' The people answered
    Joshua, 'It is the Lord our God we choose to serve; it is his voice that we
    will obey'. That day, Joshua made a covenant for the people; he laid down a
    statute and ordinance for them at Shechem. Joshua wrote these words in the
    Book of the Law of God. Then he took a great stone and set it up there,
    under the oak in the sanctuary of the Lord, and Joshua said to all the
    people, 'See! This stone shall be a witness against us because it has heard
    all the words that the Lord has spoken to us: it shall be a witness against
    you in case you deny your God.' Then Joshua sent the people away, and each
    returned to his own inheritance. After these things Joshua son of Nun, the
    servant of the Lord, died; he was a hundred and ten years old.

    A reading from the Book of Prophet Ezekiel<span class="alindcha">18:1-10.13.30-32</span>
  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    The word of the Lord was addressed to me as follows,&nbsp;'Why do you keep
    repeating this proverb in the land of Israel: The fathers have eaten unripe
    grapes; and the children's teeth are set on edge? &nbsp;'As I live - it is
    the Lord who speaks - there will no longer be any reason to repeat this
    proverb in Israel.&nbsp;See now: all life belongs to me; the father's life
    and the son's life, both alike belong to me. The man who has sinned, he is
    the one who shall die.&nbsp;'The upright man is law-abiding and
    honest;&nbsp;he does not eat on the mountains or raise his eyes to the idols
    of the House of Israel, does not seduce his neighbor's wife or sleep with a
    woman during her periods.&nbsp;He oppresses no one, returns pledges, never
    steals, gives his own bread to the hungry, his clothes to the naked.&nbsp;He
    never charges usury on loans, takes no interest, abstains from evil, gives
    honest judgment between man and man,&nbsp;keeps my laws and sincerely
    respects my observances - such a man is truly upright. It is the Lord who
    speaks.&nbsp;'But if anyone has a son prone to violence and bloodshed, who
    commits one of these misdeeds -&nbsp;charges usury on loans and takes
    interest, then this son shall certainly not live; having committed all these
    appalling crimes he will have to die, and his blood be on his own head.
    &nbsp;House of Israel, in future I mean to judge each of you by what he does
    - it is the Lord who speaks. Repent, renounce all your sins, avoid all
    occasions of sin!&nbsp;Shake off all the sins you have committed against me,
    and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why are you so anxious to
    die, House of Israel?&nbsp;I take no pleasure in the death of anyone - it is
    the Lord who speaks. Repent and live!

    People brought little children to Jesus, for him to lay his hands on them
    and say a prayer. The disciples turned them away,&nbsp;but Jesus said, 'Let

    such as these that the kingdom of heaven belongs'.&nbsp;Then he laid his
