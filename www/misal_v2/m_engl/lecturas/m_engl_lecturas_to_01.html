    In various times in the past and in various different ways, God spoke to our
    ancestors through the prophets; but &nbsp;in our own time, the last days, he
    has spoken to us through his Son, the Son that he has appointed to inherit
    everything and through whom he made everything there is. &nbsp;He is the
    radiant light of God's glory and the perfect copy of his nature, sustaining
    the universe by his powerful command; and now that he has destroyed the
    defilement of sin, he has gone to take his place in heaven at the right hand
    of divine Majesty. &nbsp;So he is now as far above the angels as the title
    which he has inherited is higher than their own name. &nbsp;God has never
    said to any angel: You are my Son, today I have become your father; will be
    a father to him and he a son to me. &nbsp;Again, when he brings the
    First-born into the world, he says: Let all the angels of God worship him.

    There was a man of Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the highlands of Ephraim whose
    name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an
    Ephraimite. &nbsp;He had two wives, one called Hannah, the other Peninnah;
    Peninnah had children but Hannah had none. &nbsp;Every year this man used to
    go up from his town to worship and to sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in
    Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there as priests of
    the Lord. &nbsp;One day Elkanah offered sacrifice. He used to give portions
    to Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters; &nbsp;to Hannah, however, he
    would give only one portion, although he loved her more, since the Lord had
    made her barren. &nbsp;Her rival would taunt her to annoy her, because the
    Lord had made her barren. &nbsp;And this went on year after year; every time
    they went up to the temple of the Lord she used to taunt her. And so Hannah
    wept and would not eat. &nbsp;Then Elkanah her husband said to her, 'Hannah,
    why are you crying and why are you not eating? Why so sad? Am I not more to
    you than ten sons?'

    After John had been arrested, Jesus went into Galilee. There he proclaimed
    the Good News from God. &nbsp;'The time has come' he said 'and the kingdom
    of God is close at hand. Repent, and believe the Good News.' &nbsp;As he was
    walking along by the Sea of Galilee he saw Simon and his brother Andrew
    casting a net in the lake - for they were fishermen. &nbsp;And Jesus said to
    them, 'Follow me and I will make you into fishers of men'. &nbsp;And at once
    they left their nets and followed him. &nbsp;Going on a little further, he
    saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John; they too were in their boat,
    mending their nets. He called them at once &nbsp;and, leaving their father
    Zebedee in the boat with the men he employed, they went after him.

    God did not appoint angels to be rulers of the world to come, and that world
    is what we are talking about. &nbsp;Somewhere there is a passage that shows
    us this. It runs: What is man that you should spare a thought for him, the
    son of man that you should care for him? &nbsp;For a short while you made
    him lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and splendour.
    &nbsp;You have put him in command of everything. Well then, if he has put
    him in command of everything, he has left nothing which is not under his
    command. At present, it is true, we are not able to see that everything has
    been put under his command, &nbsp;but we do see in Jesus one who was for a
    short while made lower than the angels and is now crowned with glory and
    splendour because he submitted to death; by God's grace he had to experience
    death for all mankind. &nbsp;As it was his purpose to bring a great many of
    his sons into glory, it was appropriate that God, for whom everything exists
    and through whom everything exists, should make perfect, through suffering,
    the leader who would take them to their salvation. &nbsp;For the one who
    sanctifies, and the ones who are sanctified, are of the same stock; that is
    why he openly calls them brothers &nbsp;in the text: I shall announce your
    name to my brothers, praise you in full assembly.

    After they had eaten in the hall, Hannah rose and took her stand before the
    Lord, while Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the
    temple of the Lord. &nbsp;In the bitterness of her soul she prayed to the
    Lord with many tears &nbsp;and made a vow, saying, ‘Lord of hosts! If you
    will take notice of the distress of your servant, and bear me in mind and
    not forget your servant and give her a manchild, I will give him to the Lord
    for the whole of his life and no razor shall ever touch his head'.
    &nbsp;While she prayed before the Lord which she did for some time, Eli was
    watching her mouth, &nbsp;for she was speaking under her breath; her lips
    were moving but her voice could not be heard. He therefore supposed that she
    was drunk &nbsp;and said to her, 'How long are you going to be in this
    drunken state? Rid yourself of your wine.' &nbsp;'No, my lord,' Hannah
    replied 'I am a woman in great trouble; I have taken neither wine nor strong
    drink - I was pouring out my soul before the Lord. &nbsp;Do not take your
    maidservant for a worthless woman; all this time I have been speaking from
    the depth of my grief and my resentment.' &nbsp;Then Eli answered her: 'Go
    in peace,' he said 'and may the God of Israel grant what you have asked of
    him'. And she said, &nbsp;'May your maidservant find favour in your sight';
    and with that the woman went away; she returned to the hall and ate and was
    dejected no longer. &nbsp;They rose early in the morning and worshipped
    before the Lord and then set out and returned to their home in Ramah.
    Elkanah had intercourse with Hannah his wife and the Lord was mindful of
    her. &nbsp;She conceived and gave birth to a son, and called him Samuel
    'since' she said 'I asked the Lord for him.'

    In the city of Capernaum, on a Sabbath, Jesus went to the synagogue and
    began to teach. &nbsp;And his teaching made a deep impression on them
    because, unlike the scribes, he taught them with authority &nbsp;In their
    synagogue just then there was a man possessed by an unclean spirit and it
    shouted, &nbsp;'What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come
    to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God.' &nbsp;But Jesus
    said sharply, 'Be quiet! Come out of him!' &nbsp;And the unclean spirit
    threw the man into convulsions and with a loud cry went out of him.
    &nbsp;The people were so astonished that they started asking each other what
    it all meant. 'Here is a teaching that is new' they said 'and with authority
    behind it: he gives orders even to unclean spirits and they obey him.'
    &nbsp;And his reputation rapidly spread everywhere, through all the
    surrounding Galilean countryside.

  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    The boy Samuel was ministering to the Lord in the presence of Eli; it was
    rare for the Lord to speak in those days; visions were uncommon.&nbsp;One
    day, it happened that Eli was lying down in his room. His eyes were
    beginning to grow dim; he could no longer see. &nbsp;The lamp of God had not
    yet gone out, and Samuel was lying in the sanctuary of the Lord where the
    ark of God was, &nbsp;when the Lord called, 'Samuel! Samuel!' He answered,
    'Here I am'. &nbsp;Then he ran to Eli and said, 'Here I am, since you called
    me'. Eli said, 'I did not call. Go back and lie down.' So he went and lay
    down. &nbsp;Once again the Lord called, 'Samuel! Samuel!' Samuel got up and
    went to Eli and said, 'Here I am, since you called me'. He replied, 'I did
    not call you, my son; go back and lie down'. &nbsp;Samuel had as yet no
    knowledge of the Lord and the word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to
    him. &nbsp;Once again the Lord called, the third time. He got up and went to
    Eli and said, 'Here I am, since you called me'. Eli then understood that it
    was the Lord who was calling the boy, &nbsp;and he said to Samuel, 'Go and
    lie down, and if someone calls say, "Speak, Lord, your servant is
    listening"'. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. &nbsp;The Lord then
    came and stood by, calling as he had done before, 'Samuel! Samuel!' Samuel
    answered, 'Speak, Lord, your servant is listening'. &nbsp;Samuel grew up and
    the Lord was with him and let no word of his fall to the ground. &nbsp;All
    Israel from Dan to Beersheba came to know that Samuel was accredited as a
    prophet of the Lord.

    On leaving the synagogue, Jesus went with James and John straight to the
    house of Simon and Andrew. &nbsp;Now Simon's mother-in-law had gone to bed
    with fever, and they told him about her straightaway. &nbsp;He went to her,
    took her by the hand and helped her up. And the fever left her and she began
    to wait on them. &nbsp;That evening, after sunset, they brought to him all
    who were sick and those who were possessed by devils. &nbsp;The whole town
    came crowding round the door, &nbsp;and he cured many who were suffering
    from diseases of one kind or another; he also cast out many devils, but he
    would not allow them to speak, because they knew who he was. &nbsp;In the
    morning, long before dawn, he got up and left the house, and went off to a
    lonely place and prayed there. &nbsp;Simon and his companions set out in
    search of him, &nbsp;and when they found him they said, 'Everybody is
    looking for you'. &nbsp;He answered, 'Let us go elsewhere, to the
    neighbouring country towns, so that I can preach there too, because that is
    why I came'. &nbsp;And he went all through Galilee, preaching in their
    synagogues and casting out devils.

    It happened at that time that the Philistines mustered to fight Israel and
    Israel went out to meet them in battle, encamping near Ebenezer while the
    Philistines were encamped at Aphek. &nbsp;The Philistines drew up their
    battle line against Israel, the battle was hotly engaged, and Israel was
    defeated by the Philistines and about four thousand of their army were
    killed on the field. &nbsp;The troops returned to the camp and the elders of
    Israel said, 'Why has the Lord allowed us to be defeated today by the
    Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of our God from Shiloh so that it may come
    among us and rescue us from the power of our enemies.' &nbsp;So the troops
    sent to Shiloh and brought away the ark of the Lord of hosts, he who is
    seated on the cherubs; the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, came with
    the ark. &nbsp;When the ark of the Lord arrived in the camp, all Israel gave
    a great shout so that the earth resounded. &nbsp;When the Philistines heard
    the noise of the shouting, they said, 'What can this great shouting in the
    Hebrew camp mean?' And they realised that the ark of the Lord had come into
    the camp. &nbsp;At this the Philistines were afraid; and they said, 'God has
    come to the camp'. 'Alas!' they cried 'This has never happened before.
    &nbsp;Alas! Who will save us from the power of this mighty God? It was he
    who struck down Egypt with every kind of plague! &nbsp;But take courage and
    be men, Philistines, or you will become slaves to the Hebrews as they have
    been slaves to you. Be men and fight.' &nbsp;So the Philistines joined
    battle and Israel was defeated, each man fleeing to his tent. The slaughter
    was great indeed, and there fell of the Israelites thirty thousand foot
    soldiers. &nbsp;The ark of God was captured too, and the two sons of Eli
    died, Hophni and Phinehas.

    A leper came to Jesus and pleaded on his knees: 'If you want to' he said
    'you can cure me'. &nbsp;Feeling sorry for him, Jesus stretched out his hand
    and touched him. 'Of course I want to!' he said. 'Be cured!' &nbsp;And the
    leprosy left him at once and he was cured. &nbsp;Jesus immediately sent him
    away and sternly ordered him, &nbsp;'Mind you say nothing to anyone, but go
    and show yourself to the priest, and make the offering for your healing
    prescribed by Moses as evidence of your recovery'. &nbsp;The man went away,
    but then started talking about it freely and telling the story everywhere,
    so that Jesus could no longer go openly into any town, but had to stay
    outside in places where nobody lived. Even so, people from all around would
    come to him.

    All the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah.
    &nbsp;'Look,' they said to him 'you are old, and your sons do not follow
    your ways. So give us a king to rule over us, like the other nations.'
    &nbsp;It displeased Samuel that they should say, 'Let us have a king to rule
    us', so he prayed to the Lord. &nbsp;But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Obey the
    voice of the people in all that they say to you, for it is not you they have
    rejected; they have rejected me from ruling over them. &nbsp;All that the
    Lord had said Samuel repeated to the people who were asking him for a king
    &nbsp;He said, 'These will be the rights of the king who is to reign over
    you. He will take your sons and assign them to his chariotry and cavalry,
    and they will run in front of his chariot. &nbsp;He will use them as leaders
    of a thousand and leaders of fifty; he will make them plough his ploughland
    and harvest his harvest and make his weapons of war and the gear for his
    chariots. &nbsp;He will also take your daughters as perfumers, cooks and
    bakers. &nbsp;He will take the best of your fields, of your vineyards and
    olive groves and give them to his officials. &nbsp;He will tithe your crops
    and vineyards to provide for his eunuchs and his officials. &nbsp;He will
    take the best of your manservants and maidservants, of your cattle and your
    donkeys, and make them work for him. &nbsp;He will tithe your flocks, and
    you yourselves will become his slaves. &nbsp;When that day comes, you will
    cry out on account of the king you have chosen for yourselves, but on that
    day God will not answer you.' &nbsp;The people refused to listen to the
    words of Samuel. They said, 'No! We want a king, &nbsp;so that we in our
    turn can be like the other nations; our king shall rule us and be our leader
    and fight our battles.' &nbsp;Samuel listened to all that the people had to
    say and repeated it in the ears of the Lord. &nbsp;The Lord then said to

    When Jesus returned to Capernaum some time later, word went round that he
    was back; &nbsp;and so many people collected that there was no room left,
    even in front of the door. He was preaching the word to them &nbsp;when some
    people came bringing him a paralytic carried by four men, &nbsp;but as the
    crowd made it impossible to get the man to him, they stripped the roof over
    the place where Jesus was; and when they had made an opening, they lowered
    the stretcher on which the paralytic lay. &nbsp;Seeing their faith, Jesus
    said to the paralytic, 'My child, your sins are forgiven'. &nbsp;Now some
    scribes were sitting there, and they thought to themselves, &nbsp;'How can
    this man talk like that? He is blaspheming. Who can forgive sins but God?'
    &nbsp;Jesus, inwardly aware that this was what they were thinking, said to
    them, 'Why do you have these thoughts in your hearts? &nbsp;Which of these
    is easier: to say to the paralytic, "Your sins are forgiven" or to say, "Get
    up, pick up your stretcher and walk"? &nbsp;But to prove to you that the Son
    of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,' - &nbsp;he said to the
    paralytic - I order you: get up, pick up your stretcher, and go off home.'
    &nbsp;And the man got up, picked up his stretcher at once and walked out in
    front of everyone, so that they were all astounded and praised God saying,
    'We have never seen anything like this'.

    The word of God is something alive and active: it cuts like any double-edged
    sword but more finely: it can slip through the place where the soul is
    divided from the spirit, or joints from the marrow; it can judge the secret
    emotions and thoughts. &nbsp;No created thing can hide from him; everything
    is uncovered and open to the eyes of the one to whom we must give account of
    ourselves. &nbsp;Since in Jesus, the Son of God, we have the supreme high
    priest who has gone through to the highest heaven, we must never let go of
    the faith that we have professed. &nbsp;For it is not as if we had a high
    priest who was incapable of feeling our weaknesses with us; but we have one
    who has been tempted in every way that we are, though he is without sin.

    A reading from the first Book of Samuel<span class="alindcha">9:1-4.17-19; 10:1</span>
  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    Among the men of Benjamin there was a man named Kish son of Abiel, son of
    Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah; a Benjaminite and a man of rank.
    &nbsp;He had a son named Saul, a handsome man in the prime of life. Of all
    the Israelites there was no one more handsome than he; he stood head and
    shoulders taller than the rest of the people. &nbsp;Now some of the
    she-donkeys of Saul's father Kish had strayed, so Kish said to Saul, 'My
    son, take one of the servants with you and be off; go and look for the
    she-donkeys'. &nbsp;They passed through the highlands of Ephraim and passed
    through the land of Shalishah, but did not find them; they passed through
    the land of Shaalim, they were not there; they passed through the land of
    Benjamin, but did not find them. &nbsp;When Samuel saw Saul, the Lord told
    him, 'That is the man of whom I told you; he shall rule my people'.
    &nbsp;Saul accosted Samuel in the gateway and said, 'Tell me, please, where
    the seer's house is?' &nbsp;Samuel replied to Saul, 'I am the seer. Go up
    ahead of me to the high place. You are to eat with me today. In the morning
    I shall take leave of you and tell you all that is in your heart.
    &nbsp;Samuel took a phial of oil and poured it on Saul's head; then he
    kissed him, saying, 'Has not the Lord anointed you prince over his people
    Israel? You are the man who must rule the Lord's people, and who must save
    them from the power of the enemies surrounding them.

    Jesus went out to the shore of the lake; and all the people came to him, and
    he taught them. &nbsp;As he was walking on he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus,
    sitting by the customs house, and he said to him, 'Follow me'. And he got up
    and followed him.&nbsp;When Jesus was at dinner in his house, a number of
    tax collectors and sinners were also sitting at the table with Jesus and his
    disciples; for there were many of them among his followers. &nbsp;When the
    scribes of the Pharisee party saw him eating with sinners and tax
    collectors, they said to his disciples, 'Why does he eat with tax collectors
    and sinners?' &nbsp;When Jesus heard this he said to them, 'It is not the
    healthy who need the doctor, but the sick. I did not come to call the
    virtuous, but sinners.'
