    Philip went to a Samaritan town and proclaimed the Christ to them. The
    people united in welcoming the message Philip preached, either because they
    had heard of the miracles he worked or because they saw them for themselves.
    There were, for example, unclean spirits that came shrieking out of many who
    were possessed, and several paralytics and cripples were cured. As a result
    there was great rejoicing in that town. When the apostles in Jerusalem heard
    that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,
    and they went down there, and prayed for the Samaritans to receive the Holy
    Spirit, for as yet he had not come down on any of them: they had only been
    baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid hands on them, and
    they received the Holy Spirit.

    Reverence the Lord Christ in your hearts, and always have your answer ready
    for people who ask you the reason for the hope that you all have. But give
    it with courtesy and respect and with a clear conscience, so that those who
    slander you when you are living a good life in Christ may be proved wrong in
    the accusations that they bring. And if it is the will of God that you
    should suffer, it is better to suffer for doing right than for doing wrong.
    Why, Christ himself, innocent though he was, had died once for sins, died
    for the guilty, to lead us to God. In the body he was put to death, in the
    spirit he was raised to life.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'If you love me you will keep my commandments.
    I shall ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate to be with you
    for ever, that Spirit of truth whom the world can never receive since it
    neither sees nor knows him; but you know him, because he is with you, he is
    in you. I will not leave you orphans; I will come back to you. In a short
    time the world will no longer see me; but you will see me, because I live
    and you will live. On that day you will understand that I am in my Father
    and you in me and I in you. Anybody who receives my commandments and keeps
    them will be one who loves me; and anybody who loves me will be loved by my
    Father, and I shall love him and show myself to him.'

    As Peter reached the house Cornelius went out to meet him, knelt at his feet
    and prostrated himself. But Peter helped him up. 'Stand up,' he said 'I am
    only a man after all!' Then Peter addressed them: 'The truth I have now come
    to realise' he said 'is that God does not have favourites, but that anybody
    of any nationality who fears God and does what is right is acceptable to
    him. While Peter was still speaking the Holy Spirit came down on all the
    listeners. Jewish believers who had accompanied Peter were astonished that
    the gift of the Holy Spirit should be poured out on the pagans too, since
    they could hear them speaking strange languages and proclaiming the
    greatness of God. Peter himself then said, 'Could anyone refuse the water of
    baptism to these people, now they have received the Holy Spirit just as much
    as we have?' He then gave orders for them to be baptised in the name of
    Jesus Christ. Afterwards they begged him to stay on for some days.

    love can never have known God, because God is love. God's love for us was
    revealed when God sent into the world his only Son so that we could have

    any more, because a servant does not know his master's business; I call you

    Some men came down from Judaea and taught the brothers, 'Unless you have
    yourselves circumcised in the tradition of Moses you cannot be saved'. This
    led to disagreement, and after Paul and Barnabas had had a long argument
    with these men it was arranged that Paul and Barnabas and others of the
    church should go up to Jerusalem and discuss the problem with the apostles
    and elders. Then the apostles and elders decided to choose delegates to send
    to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; the whole church concurred with this.
    They chose Judas known as Barsabbas and Silas, both leading men in the
    brotherhood, and gave them this letter to take with them: 'The apostles and
    elders, your brothers, send greetings to the brothers of pagan birth in
    Antioch, Syria and Cilicia. We hear that some of our members have disturbed
    you with their demands and have unsettled your minds. They acted without any
    authority from us; and so we have decided unanimously to elect delegates and
    to send them to you with Barnabas and Paul, men we highly respect who have
    dedicated their lives to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Accordingly we
    are sending you Judas and Silas, who will confirm by word of mouth what we
    have written in this letter. It has been decided by the Holy Spirit and by
    ourselves not to saddle you with any burden beyond these essentials: you are
    to abstain from food sacrificed to idols; from blood, from the meat of
    strangled animals and from fornication. Avoid these, and you will do what is
    right. Farewell.'

    In the spirit, the angel took me to the top of an enormous high mountain and
    showed me Jerusalem, the holy city, coming down from God out of heaven. It
    had all the radiant glory of God and glittered like some precious jewel of
    crystal-clear diamond. The walls of it were of a great height, and had
    twelve gates; at each of the twelve gates there was an angel, and over the
    gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel; on the east
    there were three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates,
    and on the west three gates. The city walls stood on twelve foundation
    stones, each one of which bore the name of one of the twelve apostles of the
    Lamb. I saw that there was no temple in the city since the Lord God Almighty
    and the Lamb were themselves the temple, and the city did not need the sun
    or the moon for light, since it was lit by the radiant glory of God and the
    Lamb was a lighted torch for it.

    Sailing from Troas we made a straight run for Samothrace; the next day for
    Neapolis, and from there for Philippi, a Roman colony and the principal city
    of that particular district of Macedonia. After a few days in this city we
    went along the river outside the gates as it was the sabbath and this was a
    customary place for prayer. We sat down and preached to the women who had
    come to the meeting. One of these women was called Lydia, a devout woman
    from the town of Thyatira who was in the purple-dye trade. She listened to
    us, and the Lord opened her heart to accept what Paul was saying. After she
    and her household had been baptised she sent us an invitation: 'If you
    really think me a true believer in the Lord,' she said 'come and stay with
    us'; and she would take no refusal.

    do these things because they have never known either the Father or myself.
    But I have told you all this, so that when the time for it comes you may
    remember that I told you.'

    The crowd of Philippians joined in and showed their hostility to Paul and
    Silas, so the magistrates had them stripped and ordered them to be flogged.
    They were given many lashes and then thrown into prison, and the gaoler was
    told to keep a close watch on them. So, following his instructions, he threw
    them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks. Late that
    night Paul and Silas were praying and singing God's praises, while the other
    prisoners listened. Suddenly there was an earthquake that shook the prison
    to its foundations. All the doors flew open and the chains fell from all the
    prisoners. When the gaoler woke and saw the doors wide open he drew his
    sword and was about to commit suicide, presuming that the prisoners had
    escaped.&nbsp;But Paul shouted at the top of his voice, 'Don't do yourself
    any harm; we are all here'. The gaoler called for lights, then rushed in,
    threw himself trembling at the feet of Paul and Silas, and escorted them
    out, saying, 'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?' They told him, 'Become a
    believer in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, and your household too'.
    Then they preached the word of the Lord to him and to all his family. Late
    as it was, he took them to wash their wounds, and was baptised then and
    there with all his household. Afterwards he took them home and gave them a
    meal, and the whole family celebrated their conversion to belief in God.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'Now I am going to the one who sent me. Not one
    of you has asked, "Where are you going?" Yet you are sad at heart because I
    have told you this. Still, I must tell you the truth: it is for your own

    Paul's escort took him as far as Athens, and went back with instructions for
    Silas and Timothy to rejoin Paul as soon as they could. Paul stood before
    the whole Council of the Areopagus and made this speech: “Men of Athens, I
    have seen for myself how extremely scrupulous you are in religious matters,
    because I noticed, as I strolled round admiring your sacred monuments, that
    you had an altar inscribed: To An Unknown God. Well, the God whom I proclaim
    is in fact the one whom you already worship without knowing it. “Since the
    God who made the world and everything in it is himself Lord of heaven and
    earth, he does not make his home in shrines made by human hands. Nor is he
    dependent on anything that human hands can do for him, since he can never be
    in need of anything; on the contrary, it is he who gives everything –
    including life and breath – to everyone. Form one single stock he not only
    created the whole human race so that they could occupy the entire earth, but
    he decreed how long each nation should flourish and what the boundaries of
    its territory should be. And he did this so that all nations might seek the
    deity and, by feeling their way towards him, succeed in finding him. Yet in
    fact he is not far from any of us, since it is in him that we live, and
    move, and exist, as indeed some of your own writers have said: ‘We are all
    his children.' “Since we are the children of God, we have no excuse for
    thinking that the deity looks like anything in gold, silver or stone that
    has been carved and designed by a man. “God overlooked that sort of thing
    when men were ignorant, but now he is telling everyone everywhere that they
    must repent, because he has fixed a day when the whole world will be judged,
    and judged in righteousness, and he has appointed a man to be the judge. And
    God has publicly proved this by raising this man from the dead.” At this
    mention of rising from the dead, some of them burst out laughing; others
    said, “We would like to hear you talk about this again.” After that Paul
    left them, but there were some who attached themselves to him and became
    believers, among them Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman called Damaris,
    and others besides. After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.

  <p>
    In my earlier work, Theophilus, I dealt with everything Jesus had done and
    taught from the beginning until the day he gave his instructions to the
    apostles he had chosen through the Holy Spirit, and was taken up to heaven.
    He had shown himself alive to them after his Passion by many demonstrations:
    for forty days he had continued to appear to them and tell them about the
    kingdom of God. When he had been at table with them, he had told them not to
    leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for what the Father had promised. 'It is'
    he had said 'what you have heard me speak about: John baptised with water
    but you, not many days from now, will be baptised with the Holy Spirit.' Now
    having met together, they asked him, 'Lord, has the time come? Are you going
    to restore the kingdom to Israel?' He replied, 'It is not for you to know
    times or dates that the Father has decided by his own authority, but you
    will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you, and then you will be
    my witnesses not only in Jerusalem but throughout Judaea and Samaria, and
    indeed to the ends of the earth'. As he said this he was lifted up while
    they looked on, and a cloud took him from their sight. They were still
    staring into the sky when suddenly two men in white were standing near them
    and they said, 'Why are you men from Galilee standing here looking into the
    sky? Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, this same Jesus will
    come back in the same way as you have seen him go there.'

    It is not as though Christ had entered a man-made sanctuary which was merely
    a model of the real one; he entered heaven itself, so that he now appears in
    the presence of God on our behalf. And he does not have to offer himself
    again and again, as the high priest goes into the sanctuary year after year
    with the blood that is not his own, or else he would have had to suffer over
    and over again since the world began. As it is, he has made his appearance
    once and for all, at the end of the last age, to do away with sin by
    sacrificing himself. Since human beings die only once, after which comes
    judgement, so Christ too, having offered himself only once to bear the sin
    of many, will manifest himself a second time, sin being no more, to those
    who are waiting for him, to bring them salvation.<br />We have then,
    brothers, complete confidence through the blood of Jesus in entering the
    sanctuary, by a new way which he has opened for us, a living opening through
    the curtain, that is to say, his flesh. And we have the high priest over all
    the sanctuary of God. So as we go in, let us be sincere in heart and filled
    with faith, our hearts sprinkled and free from any trace of bad conscience,
    and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us keep firm in the hope we
    profess, because the one who made the promise is trustworthy.

    arranged to meet them. When they saw him they fell down before him, though

    Jesus showed himself to the Eleven, and said to them, 'Go out to the whole
    world; proclaim the Good News to all creation. He who believes and is
    baptised will be saved; he who does not believe will be condemned. These are
    the signs that will be associated with believers: in my name they will cast
    out devils; they will have the gift of tongues; they will pick up snakes in
    their hands, and be unharmed should they drink deadly poison; they will lay
    their hands on the sick, who will recover.' And so the Lord Jesus, after he
    had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven: there at the right hand of God
    he took his place, while they, going out, preached everywhere, the Lord
    working with them and confirming the word by the signs that accompanied it.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'You see how it is written that the Christ
    would suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that, in his name,
    repentance for the forgiveness of sins would be preached to all the nations,
    beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses to this. 'And now I am sending
    down to you what the Father has promised. Stay in the city then, until you
    are clothed with the power from on high.' Then he took them out as far as
    the outskirts of Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them. Now as
    he blessed them, he withdrew from them and was carried up to heaven. They
    worshipped him and then went back to Jerusalem full of joy; and they were
    continually in the Temple praising God.

    Paul left Athens and went to Corinth, where he met a Jew called Aquila whose
    family came from Pontus. He and his wife Priscilla had recently left Italy
    because an edict of Claudius had expelled all the Jews from Rome. Paul went
    to visit them, and when he found they were tentmakers, of the same trade as
    himself, he lodged with them, and they worked together. Every sabbath he
    used to hold debates in the synagogues, trying to convert Jews as well as
    Greeks. After Silas and Timothy had arrived from Macedonia, Paul devoted all
    his time to preaching, declaring to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. When
    they turned against him and started to insult him, he took his cloak and
    shook it out in front of them, saying, 'Your blood be on your own heads;
    from now on I can go to the pagans with a clear conscience'. Then he left
    the synagogue and moved to the house next door that belonged to a worshipper
    of God called Justus. Crispus, president of the synagogue, and his whole
    household, all became believers in the Lord. A great many Corinthians who
    had heard him became believers and were baptised.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'In a short time you will no longer see me, and
    then a short time later you will see me again.' Then some of his disciples
    said to one another, 'What does he mean, "In a short time you will no longer
    see me, and then a short time later you will see me again" and, "I am going
    to the Father"? What is this "short time"? We don't know what he means.'
    Jesus knew that they wanted to question him, so he said, 'You are asking one
    another what I meant by saying: In a short time you will no longer see me,
    and then a short time later you will see me again. 'I tell you most
    solemnly, you will be weeping and wailing while the world will rejoice; you
    will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn to joy.'

    At Corinth one night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision, 'Do not be afraid
    to speak out, nor allow yourself to be silenced: I am with you. I have so
    many people on my side in this city that no one will even attempt to hurt
    you.' So Paul stayed there preaching the word of God among them for eighteen
    months. But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a concerted
    attack on Paul and brought him before the tribunal. 'We accuse this man'
    they said 'of persuading people to worship God in a way that breaks the
    Law.' Before Paul could open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, 'Listen,
    you Jews. If this were a misdemeanour or a crime, I would not hesitate to
    attend to you; but if it is only quibbles about words and names, and about
    your own Law, then you must deal with it yourselves-I have no intention of
    making legal decisions about things like that.' Then he sent them out of the
    court, and at once they all turned on Sosthenes, the synagogue president,
    and beat him in front of the court house. Gallio refused to take any notice
    at all. After staying on for some time, Paul took leave of the brothers and
    sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchreae he had
    his hair cut off, because of a vow he had made.

    Paul came down to Antioch where he spent a short time before continuing his
    journey through the Galatian country and then through Phrygia, encouraging
    all the followers. An Alexandrian Jew named Apollos now arrived in Ephesus.
    He was an eloquent man, with a sound knowledge of the scriptures, and yet,
    though he had been given instruction in the Way of the Lord and preached
    with great spiritual earnestness and was accurate in all the details he
    taught about Jesus, he had only experienced the baptism of John. When
    Priscilla and Aquila heard him speak boldly in the synagogue, they took an
    interest in him and gave him further instruction about the Way. When Apollos
    thought of crossing over to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote
    asking the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived there he was able by
    God's grace to help the believers considerably by the energetic way he
    refuted the Jews in public and demonstrated from the scriptures that Jesus
    was the Christ.
