    Elijah went a day's journey into the wilderness, until he came to a solitary
    broom tree and sat beneath it. He prayed for death: “Enough, LORD! Take my
    life, for I am no better than my ancestors.” He lay down and fell asleep
    under the solitary broom tree, but suddenly a messenger* touched him and
    said, “Get up and eat!” He looked and there at his head was a hearth cake
    and a jug of water. After he ate and drank, he lay down again, but the angel
    of the Lord came back a second time, touched him, and said, “Get up and eat
    or the journey will be too much for you!” He got up, ate, and drank; then
    strengthened by that food, he walked forty days and forty nights to the
    mountain of God, Horeb. There he came to a cave, where he took shelter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then the Lord said: Go out and stand on the mountain before the Lord;* the
    Lord will pass by. There was a strong and violent wind rending the mountains
    and crushing rocks before the Lord—but the Lord was not in the wind; after
    the wind, an earthquake—but the Lord was not in the earthquake; after the
    earthquake, fire—but the Lord was not in the fire; after the fire, a light
    silent sound. When he heard this, Elijah hid his face in his cloak and went
    out and stood at the entrance of the cave. A voice said to him, Why are you
    here, Elijah? He replied, “I have been most zealous for the Lord, the God of
    hosts, but the Israelites have forsaken your covenant. They have destroyed
    your altars and murdered your prophets by the sword. I alone remain, and
    they seek to take my life.” The Lord said to him: Go back! Take the desert
    road to Damascus.

    The reign of the Lord our God Almighty has begun; let us be glad and joyful
    and give praise to God, because this is the time for the marriage of the
    Lamb. His bride is ready, and she has been able to dress herself in dazzling

    how many of you were wise in the ordinary sense of the word, how many were
    influential people, or came from noble families? No, it was to shame the
    wise that God chose what is foolish by human reckoning, and to shame what is

    thinks common and contemptible are the ones that God has chosen - those who
    are nothing at all to show up those who are everything. The human race has
    nothing to boast about to God, but you, God has made members of Christ Jesus

    Be ambitious for the higher gifts. And I am going to show you a way that is
    better than any of them. If I have all the eloquence of men or of angels,
    but speak without love, I am simply a gong booming or a cymbal clashing. If
    I have the gift of prophecy, understanding all the mysteries there are, and
    knowing everything, and if I have faith in all its fullness, to move
    mountains, but without love, then I am nothing at all. If I give away all
    that I possess, piece by piece, and if I even let them take my body to burn
    it, but am without love, it will do me no good whatever. Love is always
    patient and kind; it is never jealous; love is never boastful or conceited;
    it is never rude or selfish; it does not take offence, and is not resentful.
    &nbsp;Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins but delights in the
    truth; it is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure
    whatever comes. Love does not come to an end. But if there are gifts of
    prophecy, the time will come when they must fail; or the gift of languages,
    it will not continue for ever; and knowledge - for this, too, the time will
    come when it must fail. &nbsp;For our knowledge is imperfect and our
    prophesying is imperfect; but once perfection comes, all imperfect things
    will disappear. When I was a child, I used to talk like a child, and think
    like a child, and argue like a child, but now I am a man, all childish ways
    are put behind me. Now we are seeing a dim reflection in a mirror; but then
    we shall be seeing face to face. The knowledge that I have now is imperfect;
    but then I shall know as fully as I am known. &nbsp;In short, there are
    three things that last: faith, hope and love; and the greatest of these is
    love.

    Christ and be given a place in him. I am no longer trying for perfection by
    my own efforts, the perfection that comes from the Law, but I want only the
    perfection that comes through faith in Christ, and is from God and based on
    faith. All I want is to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and to
    share his sufferings by reproducing the pattern of his death. That is the
    way I can hope to take my place in the resurrection of the dead. Not that I
    have become perfect yet: I have not yet won, but I am still running, trying
    to capture the prize for which Christ Jesus captured me. I can assure you my

    In the same way, wives should be obedient to their husbands. Then, if there
    are some husbands who have not yet obeyed the word, they may find themselves
    won over, without a word spoken, by the way their wives behave, when they
    see how faithful and conscientious they are. Do not dress up for show: doing
    up your hair, wearing gold bracelets and fine clothes; all this should be
    inside, in a person's heart, imperishable: the ornament of a sweet and
    gentle disposition - this is what is precious in the sight of God. That was
    how the holy women of the past dressed themselves attractively - they hoped
    in God and were tender and obedient to their husbands; like Sarah, who was
    obedient to Abraham, and called him her lord. You are now her children, as
    long as you live good lives and do not give way to fear or worry. In the
    same way, husbands must always treat their wives with consideration in their
    life together, respecting a woman as one who, though she may be the weaker
    partner, is equally an heir to the life of grace. This will stop anything
    from coming in the way of your prayers. Finally: you should all agree among
    yourselves and be sympathetic; love the brothers, have compassion and be
    self-effacing. Never pay back one wrong with another, or an angry word with
    another one; instead, pay back with a blessing. That is what you are called
    to do, so that you inherit a blessing yourself.

    who will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the person who does the will of my
    Father in heaven. When the day comes many will say to me, "Lord, Lord, did
    we not prophesy in your name, cast out demons in your name, work many
    miracles in your name?" Then I shall tell them to their faces: I have never
    known you; away from me, you evil men!' 'Therefore, everyone who listens to
    these words of mine and acts on them will be like a sensible man who built
    his house on rock. Rain came down, floods rose, gales blew and hurled
    themselves against that house, and it did not fall: it was founded on rock.
    But everyone who listens to these words of mine and does not act on them
    will be like a stupid man who built his house on sand. Rain came down,
    floods rose, gales blew and struck that house, and it fell; and what a fall
    it had!'

    At that time Jesus exclaimed, 'I bless you, Father, Lord of heaven and of
    earth, for hiding these things from the learned and the clever and revealing
    them to mere children. Yes, Father, for that is what it pleased you to do.
    Everything has been entrusted to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son
    except the Father, just as no one knows the Father except the Son and those
    to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. 'Come to me, all you who labour and

    me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your
    souls. Yes, my yoke is easy and my burden light.'

    wants to save his life will lose it; but anyone who loses his life for my
    sake will find it. What, then, will a man gain if he wins the whole world

    Some Pharisees approached Jesus, and to test him they said, 'Is it against
    the Law for a man to divorce his wife on any pretext whatever?' He answered,
    'Have you not read that the creator from the beginning made them male and
    female and that he said: This is why a man must leave father and mother, and
    cling to his wife, and the two become one body? They are no longer two,
    therefore, but one body. So then, what God has united, man must not divide'.
    They said to him, 'Then why did Moses command that a writ of dismissal
    should be given in cases of divorce?' 'It was because you were so
    unteachable' he said 'that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but it
    was not like this from the beginning. Now I say this to you: the man who
    divorces his wife - I am not speaking of fornication - and marries another,
    is guilty of adultery.' The disciples said to him, 'If that is how things
    are between husband and wife, it is not advisable to marry'. But he replied,
    'It is not everyone who can accept what I have said, but only those to whom
    it is granted. There are eunuchs born that way from their mother's womb,
    there are eunuchs made so by men and there are eunuchs who have made
    themselves that way for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept
    this who can.'

    But when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees they got
    together &nbsp;and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,
    &nbsp;'Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?' &nbsp;Jesus
    said, 'You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your
    soul, and with all your mind. &nbsp;This is the greatest and the first
    commandment. &nbsp;The second resembles it: You must love your neighbour as

    Jesus told this parable to his disciples: 'The kingdom of heaven will be
    like this: Ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went to meet the
    bridegroom.&nbsp;Five of them were foolish and five were sensible: &nbsp;the
    foolish ones did take their lamps, but they brought no oil, &nbsp;whereas
    the sensible ones took flasks of oil as well as their lamps. &nbsp;The
    bridegroom was late, and they all grew drowsy and fell asleep. &nbsp;But at
    midnight there was a cry, "The bridegroom is here! Go out and meet
    him."&nbsp;At this, all those bridesmaids woke up and trimmed their lamps,
    &nbsp;and the foolish ones said to the sensible ones, "Give us some of your
    oil: our lamps are going out". &nbsp;But they replied, "There may not be
    enough for us and for you; you had better go to those who sell it and buy
    some for yourselves". &nbsp;They had gone off to buy it when the bridegroom
    arrived. Those who were ready went in with him to the wedding hall and the
    door was closed. &nbsp;The other bridesmaids arrived later. "Lord, Lord,"
    they said "open the door for us." &nbsp;But he replied, "I tell you
    solemnly, I do not know you". &nbsp;So stay awake, because you do not know
    either the day or the hour.

    Jesus spoke this parable to his disciples: A man on his way abroad summoned
    his servants and entrusted his property to them.&nbsp;To one he gave five
    talents, to another two, to a third one; each in proportion to his ability.
    Then he set out. &nbsp;The man who had received the five talents promptly
    went and traded with them and made five more. &nbsp;The man who had received
    two made two more in the same way. &nbsp;But the man who had received one
    went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money. &nbsp;Now
    a long time after, the master of those servants came back and went through
    his accounts with them. &nbsp;The man who had received the five talents came
    forward bringing five more. "Sir," he said "you entrusted me with five
    talents; here are five more that I have made." &nbsp;His master said to him,
    "Well done, good and faithful servant; you have shown you can be faithful in
    small things, I will trust you with greater; come and join in your master's
    happiness". &nbsp;Next the man with the two talents came forward. "Sir," he
    said "you entrusted me with two talents; here are two more that I have
    made." &nbsp;His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant;
    you have shown you can be faithful in small things, I will trust you with
    greater; come and join in your master's happiness". &nbsp;Last came forward
    the man who had the one talent. "Sir," said he "I had heard you were a hard
    man, reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not
    scattered; &nbsp;so I was afraid, and I went off and hid your talent in the
    ground. Here it is; it was yours, you have it back." &nbsp;But his master
    answered him, "You wicked and lazy servant! So you knew that I reap where I
    have not sown and gather where I have not scattered? &nbsp;Well then, you
    should have deposited my money with the bankers, and on my return I would
    have recovered my capital with interest. &nbsp;So now, take the talent from
    him and give it to the man who has the five talents. &nbsp;For to everyone
    who has will be given more, and he will have more than enough; but from the
    man who has not, even what he has will be taken away. &nbsp;As for this
    good-for-nothing servant, throw him out into the dark, where there will be
    weeping and grinding of teeth."

    They had been discussing among themselves on the way who was the greatest.
    Then he sat down, called the Twelve, and said to them, “If anyone wishes to
    be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all.” Taking a
    child he placed it in their midst, and putting his arms around it he said to

    People were bringing little children to Jesus, for him to touch them. The
    disciples turned them away, but when Jesus saw this he was indignant and
    said to them, 'Let the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it
    is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. I tell you solemnly,
    anyone who does not welcome the kingdom of God like a little child will
    never enter it.' Then he put his arms round them, laid his hands on them and
    gave them his blessing.

    Jesus was setting out on a journey when a man ran up, knelt before him and
    put this question to him, 'Good master, what must I do to inherit eternal
    life?' &nbsp;Jesus said to him, 'Why do you call me good? No one is good but
    God alone. &nbsp;You know the commandments: You must not kill; You must not
    commit adultery; You must not steal; You must not bring false witness; You
    must not defraud; Honour your father and mother.' &nbsp;And he said to him,
    'Master, I have kept all these from my earliest days'. &nbsp;Jesus looked
    steadily at him and loved him, and he said, 'There is one thing you lack. Go
    and sell everything you own and give the money to the poor, and you will
    have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.' &nbsp;But his face fell at
    these words and he went away sad, for he was a man of great wealth.
    &nbsp;Jesus looked round and said to his disciples, 'How hard it is for
    those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!' &nbsp;The disciples were
    astounded by these words, but Jesus insisted, 'My children,' he said to them
    'how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! &nbsp;It is easier for a camel
    to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom
    of God.' &nbsp;They were more astonished than ever. 'In that case' they said
    to one another 'who can be saved?' &nbsp;Jesus gazed at them. 'For men' he
    said 'it is impossible, but not for God: because everything is possible for
    God.' &nbsp;Peter took this up. 'What about us?' he asked him. 'We have left
    everything and followed you.' &nbsp;Jesus said, 'I tell you solemnly, there
    is no one who has left house, brothers, sisters, father, children or land
    for my sake and for the sake of the gospel &nbsp;who will not be repaid a
    hundred times over, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and land -
    not without persecutions - now in this present time and, in the world to
    come, eternal life.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'I say this to you who are listening: Love your
    enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for
    those who treat you badly. To the man who slaps you on one cheek, present
    the other cheek too; to the man who takes your cloak from you, do not refuse
    your tunic. Give to everyone who asks you, and do not ask for your property
    back from the man who robs you. Treat others as you would like them to treat
    you. If you love those who love you, what thanks can you expect? Even
    sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who do good to
    you, what thanks can you expect? For even sinners do that much. And if you
    lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what thanks can you expect?
    Even sinners lend to sinners to get back the same amount. Instead, love your
    enemies and do good, and lend without any hope of return. You will have a
    great reward, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he himself is kind
    to the ungrateful and the wicked. 'Be compassionate as your Father is
    compassionate. Do not judge, and you will not be judged yourselves; do not
    condemn, and you will not be condemned yourselves; grant pardon, and you
    will be pardoned. Give, and there will be gifts for you: a full measure,
    pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be poured into your
    lap; because the amount you measure out is the amount you will be given
    back.'

    As Jesus and his disciples traveled along they met a man on the road who
    said to him, 'I will follow you wherever you go'. &nbsp;Jesus answered,
    'Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man
    has nowhere to lay his head'. &nbsp;Another to whom he said, 'Follow me',
    replied, 'Let me go and bury my father first'. &nbsp;But he answered, 'Leave
    the dead to bury their dead; your duty is to go and spread the news of the
    kingdom of God '. &nbsp;Another said, 'I will follow you, sir, but first let
    me go and say good-bye to my people at home'. &nbsp;Jesus said to him, 'Once
    the hand is laid on the plough, no one who looks back is fit for the kingdom
    of God '.

    Jesus came to a village, and a woman named Martha welcomed him into her
    house. &nbsp;She had a sister called Mary, who sat down at the Lord's feet
    and listened to him speaking. &nbsp;Now Martha who was distracted with all
    the serving said, 'Lord, do you not care that my sister is leaving me to do
    the serving all by myself? Please tell her to help me.' &nbsp;But the Lord
    answered: 'Martha, Martha,' he said 'you worry and fret about so many
    things, &nbsp;and yet few are needed, indeed only one. It is Mary who has
    chosen the better part; it is not to be taken from her.'

    “Gird your loins and light your lamps and be like servants who await their
    master's return from a wedding, ready to open immediately when he comes and
    knocks. Blessed are those servants whom the master finds vigilant on his
    arrival. Amen, I say to you, he will gird himself, have them recline at
    table, and proceed to wait on them. And should he come in the second or
    third watch and find them prepared in this way, blessed are those servants.
    Be sure of this: if the master of the house had known the hour when the
    thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. You also
    must be prepared, for at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will
    come.”

    Great crowds accompanied Jesus on his way and he turned and spoke to them.
    &nbsp;If any man comes to me without hating his father, mother, wife,
    children, brothers, sisters, yes and his own life too, he cannot be my
    disciple. &nbsp;Anyone who does not carry his cross and come after me cannot
    be my disciple. &nbsp;'And indeed, which of you here, intending to build a
    tower, would not first sit down and work out the cost to see if he had
    enough to complete it? &nbsp;Otherwise, if he laid the foundation and then
    found himself unable to finish the work, the onlookers would all start
    making fun of him and saying, "' &nbsp;Here is a man who started to build
    and was unable to finish". &nbsp;Or again, what king marching to war against
    another king would not first sit down and consider whether with ten thousand
    men he could stand up to the other who advanced against him with twenty
    thousand? &nbsp;If not, then while the other king was still a long way off,
    he would send envoys to sue for peace. &nbsp;So in the same way, none of you
    can be my disciple unless he gives up all his possessions.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'I am the true vine, and my Father is the
    vinedresser. Every branch in me that bears no fruit he cuts away, and every
    branch that does bear fruit he prunes to make it bear even more. You are
    pruned already, by means of the word that I have spoken to you. Make your
    home in me, as I make mine in you. As a branch cannot bear fruit all by
    itself, but must remain part of the vine, neither can you unless you remain
    in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me, with me
    in him, bears fruit in plenty; for cut off from me you can do nothing.
    Anyone who does not remain in me is like a branch that has been thrown away
    - he withers; these branches are collected and thrown on the fire, and they
    are burnt. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, you may ask what
    you will and you shall get it. It is to the glory of my Father that you
    should bear much fruit, and then you will be my disciples.

    love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and remain in his love. I
    have told you this so that my own joy may be in you and your joy be
    complete. This is my commandment: love one another, as I have loved you. A
    man can have no greater love than to lay down his life for his friends. You
    are my friends, if you do what I command you. I shall not call you servants
    any more, because a servant does not know his master's business; I call you
    friends, because I have made known to you everything I have learnt from my
    Father. You did not choose me, no, I chose you; and I commissioned you to go
    out and to bear fruit, fruit that will last; and then the Father will give
    you anything you ask him in my name. What I command you is to love one
    another.

    they all be one. Father, may they be one in us, as you are in me and I am in
