    The Lord spoke to Moses, 'Go down now, because your people whom you brought
    out of Egypt have apostasised. They have been quick to leave the way I
    marked out for them; they have made themselves a calf of molten metal and
    have worshipped it and offered it sacrifice. "Here is your God, Israel,"
    they have cried "who brought you up from the land of Egypt!"' The Lord said
    to Moses, 'I can see how headstrong these people are! Leave me, now, my
    wrath shall blaze out against them and devour them; of you, however, I will
    make a great nation.' But Moses pleaded with the Lord his God. 'Lord,' he
    said 'why should your wrath blaze out against this people of yours whom you
    brought out of the land of Egypt with arm outstretched and mighty hand? Why
    let the Egyptians say, "Ah, it was in treachery that he brought them out, to
    do them to death in the mountains and wipe them off the face of the earth"?
    Leave your burning wrath; relent and do not bring this disaster on your
    people. Remember Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, your servants to whom by your own
    self you swore and made this promise: I will make your offspring as many as
    the stars of heaven, and all this land which I promised I will give to your
    descendants, and it shall be their heritage for ever.' So the Lord relented
    and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.

  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    The Lord said to Samuel, 'Fill your horn with oil and go. I am sending you
    to Jesse of Bethlehem, for I have chosen myself a king among his sons.' When
    they arrived, he caught sight of Eliab and thought, 'Surely the Lord's
    anointed one stands there before him', but the Lord said to Samuel, 'Take no
    notice of his appearance or his height for I have rejected him; God does not
    see as man sees; man looks at appearances but the Lord looks at the heart'.
    Jesse then called Abinadab and presented him to Samuel, who said, The Lord
    has not chosen this one either'. Jesse then presented Shammah, but Samuel
    said, The Lord has not chosen this one either'. Jesse presented his seven
    sons to Samuel, but Samuel said to Jesse, ‘The Lord has not chosen these'.
    He then asked Jesse, 'Are these all the sons you have?' He answered, 'There
    is still one left, the youngest; he is out looking after the sheep'. Then
    Samuel said to Jesse, 'Send for him; we will not sit down to eat until he
    comes'. Jesse had him sent for, a boy of fresh complexion, with fine eyes
    and pleasant bearing. The Lord said, 'Come, anoint him, for this is the
    one'. At this, Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him where he stood
    with his brothers; and the spirit of the Lord seized on David and stayed
    with him from that day on. As for Samuel, he rose and went to Ramah.

    In the year of King Uzziah's death I saw the Lord seated on a high throne;
    his train filled the sanctuary; above him stood seraphs, each one with six
    wings: two to cover its face, two to cover its feet and two for flying. And
    they cried out one to another in this way, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of
    hosts. His glory fills the whole earth.' The foundations of the threshold
    shook with the voice of the one who cried out and the Temple was filled with
    smoke. I said: 'What a wretched state I am in! I am lost, for I am a man of
    unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have
    looked at the King, the Lord of hosts.' Then one of the seraphs flew to me,
    holding in his hand a live coal which he had taken from the altar with a
    pair of tongs. With this he touched my mouth and said: 'See now, this has
    touched your lips, your sin is taken away, your iniquity is purged'. Then I
    heard the voice of the Lord saying: 'Whom shall I send? Who will be our
    messenger?' I answered, 'Here I am, send me'.

    In the light of the grace I have received I want to urge each one among you
    not to exaggerate his real importance. Each of you must judge himself
    soberly by the standard of the faith God has given him. Just as each of our
    bodies has several parts and each part has a separate function, so all of
    us, in union with Christ, form one body, and as parts of it we belong to
    each other. Our gifts differ according to the grace given us. If your gift
    is prophecy, then use it as your faith suggests; &nbsp;if administration,
    then use it for administration; if teaching, then use it for teaching. Let
    the preachers deliver sermons, the almsgivers give freely, the officials be
    diligent, and those who do works of mercy do them cheerfully. Do not let
    your love be a pretence, but sincerely prefer good to evil. Love each other
    as much as brothers should, and have a profound respect for each other. Work
    for the Lord with untiring effort and with great earnestness of spirit. If
    you have hope, this will make you cheerful. Do not give up if trials come;
    and keep on praying. If any of the saints are in need you must share with
    them; and you should make hospitality your special care.

    The language of the cross may be illogical to those who are not on the way
    to salvation, but those of us who are on the way see it as God's power to
    save. As scripture says: I shall destroy the wisdom of the wise and bring to
    nothing all the learning of the learned. Where are the philosophers now?
    Where are the scribes? Where are any of our thinkers today? Do you see now
    how God has shown up the foolishness of human wisdom? If it was God's wisdom
    that human wisdom should not know God, it was because God wanted to save
    those who have faith through the foolishness of the message that we preach.
    And so, while the Jews demand miracles and the Greeks look for wisdom, here
    are we preaching a crucified Christ; to the Jews an obstacle that they
    cannot get over, to the pagans madness, but to those who have been called,
    whether they are Jews or Greeks, a Christ who is the power and the wisdom of
    God. For God's foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God's weakness is
    stronger than human strength.

    The love of Christ overwhelms us when we reflect that if one man has died
    for all, then all men should be dead; and the reason he died for all was so
    that living men should live no longer for themselves, but for him who died
    and was raised to life for them. From now onwards, therefore, we do not
    judge anyone by the standards of the flesh. Even if we did once know Christ
    in the flesh, that is not how we know him now. And for anyone who is in
    Christ, there is a new creation; the old creation has gone, and now the new
    one is here. It is all God's work. It was God who reconciled us to himself
    through Christ and gave us the work of handing on this reconciliation. In
    other words, God in Christ was reconciling the world to himself, not holding
    men's faults against them, and he has entrusted to us the news that they are
    reconciled. So we are ambassadors for Christ; it is as though God were
    appealing through us, and the appeal that we make in Christ's name is: be
    reconciled to God.

    Jesus went around to all the towns and villages, teaching in their
    synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and curing every disease
    and illness. At the sight of the crowds, his heart was moved with pity for
    them because they were troubled and abandoned, like sheep without a
    shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is abundant but the
    laborers are few; so ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for
    his harvest.”

    When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi he put this question to
    his disciples, 'Who do people say the Son of Man is?' And they said, 'Some
    say he is John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the
    prophets'. 'But you,' he said 'who do you say I am?' Then Simon Peter spoke
    up, 'You are the Christ,' he said 'the Son of the living God'. Jesus
    replied, 'Simon son of Jonah, you are a happy man! Because it was not flesh
    and blood that revealed this to you but my Father in heaven. So I now say to
    you: You are Peter and on this rock I will build my Church. And the gates of
    the underworld can never hold out against it. I will give you the keys of
    the kingdom of heaven: whatever you bind on earth shall be considered bound
    in heaven; whatever you loose on earth shall be considered loosed in
    heaven.'

    The eleven disciples set out for Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had
    arranged to meet them. When they saw him they fell down before him, though
    some hesitated. Jesus came up and spoke to them. He said, 'All authority in
    heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go, therefore, make disciples of
    all the nations; baptise them in the name of the Father and of the Son and
    of the Holy Spirit, and teach them to observe all the commands I gave you.
    And know that I am with you always; yes, to the end of time.'

    After John had been arrested, Jesus went into Galilee. There he proclaimed
    the Good News from God. &nbsp;'The time has come' he said 'and the kingdom
    of God is close at hand. Repent, and believe the Good News.' &nbsp;As he was
    walking along by the Sea of Galilee he saw Simon and his brother Andrew
    casting a net in the lake - for they were fishermen. &nbsp;And Jesus said to
    them, 'Follow me and I will make you into fishers of men'. &nbsp;And at once
    they left their nets and followed him. &nbsp;Going on a little further, he
    saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John; they too were in their boat,
    mending their nets. He called them at once &nbsp;and, leaving their father
    Zebedee in the boat with the men he employed, they went after him.

    Jesus showed himself to the Eleven, and said to them, 'Go out to the whole
    world; proclaim the Good News to all creation. He who believes and is
    baptised will be saved; he who does not believe will be condemned. These are
    the signs that will be associated with believers: in my name they will cast
    out devils; they will have the gift of tongues; they will pick up snakes in
    their hands, and be unharmed should they drink deadly poison; they will lay
    their hands on the sick, who will recover.' And so the Lord Jesus, after he
    had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven: there at the right hand of God
    he took his place, while they, going out, preached everywhere, the Lord
    working with them and confirming the word by the signs that accompanied it.

    Jesus was standing one day by the Lake of Gennesaret, with the crowd
    pressing round him listening to the word of God, &nbsp;when he caught sight
    of two boats close to the bank. The fishermen had gone out of them and were
    washing their nets. &nbsp;He got into one of the boats -it was Simon's- and
    asked him to put out a little from the shore. Then he sat down and taught
    the crowds from the boat. &nbsp;When he had finished speaking he said to
    Simon, 'Put out into deep water and pay out your nets for a catch'.
    &nbsp;'Master,' Simon replied 'we worked hard all night long and caught
    nothing, but if you say so, I will pay out the nets.' &nbsp;And when they
    had done this they netted such a huge number of fish that their nets began
    to tear, &nbsp;so they signaled to their companions in the other boat to
    come and help them; when these came, they filled the two boats to sinking
    point. &nbsp;When Simon Peter saw this he fell at the knees of Jesus saying,
    'Leave me, Lord; I am a sinful man'. &nbsp;For he and all his companions
    were completely overcome by the catch they had made; &nbsp;so also were
    James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were Simon's partners. But Jesus said
    to Simon, 'Do not be afraid; from now on it is men you will catch'.
    &nbsp;Then, bringing their boats back to land, they left everything and
    followed him.

    The Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them out ahead of him, in
    pairs, to all the towns and places he himself was to visit. &nbsp;He said to
    them, 'The harvest is rich but the labourers are few, so ask the Lord of the
    harvest to send labourers to his harvest.&nbsp;Start off now, but remember,
    I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. &nbsp;Carry no purse, no
    haversack, no sandals. Salute no one on the road. &nbsp;Whatever house you
    go into, let your first words be, "Peace to this house!" &nbsp;And if a man
    of peace lives there, your peace will go and rest on him; if not, it will
    come back to you. &nbsp;Stay in the same house, taking what food and drink
    they have to offer, for the labourer deserves his wages; do not move from
    house to house. &nbsp;Whenever you go into a town where they make you
    welcome, eat what is set before you. &nbsp;Cure those in it who are sick,
    and say, "The kingdom of God is very near to you".

    dispute arose also between them about which should be reckoned the greatest,
    but Jesus said to them, 'Among pagans it is the kings who lord it over them,
    and those who have authority over them are given the title Benefactor. This
    must not happen with you. No; the greatest among you must behave as if he
    were the youngest, the leader as if he were the one who serves. For who is
    the greater: the one at table or the one who serves? The one at table,
    surely? Yet here am I among you as one who serves! 'You are the men who have
    stood by me faithfully in my trials; and now I confer a kingdom on you, just
    as my Father conferred one on me: you will eat and drink at my table in my
    kingdom, and you will sit on thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.

    Jesus said: I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd is one who lays down
    his life for his sheep. 10:12The hired man, since he is not the shepherd and
    the sheep do not belong to him, abandons the sheep and runs away as soon as
    he sees a wolf coming, and then the wolf attacks and scatters the sheep;
    this is because he is only a hired man and has no concern for the sheep. I
    am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me, 10:15just as the
    Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for my sheep.
    10:16And there are other sheep I have that are not of this fold, and these I
    have to lead as well. They too will listen to my voice, and there will be
    only one flock, and one shepherd.

    love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and remain in his love. I
    have told you this so that my own joy may be in you and your joy be

    man can have no greater love than to lay down his life for his friends. You
    are my friends, if you do what I command you. I shall not call you servants
    any more, because a servant does not know his master's business; I call you
    friends, because I have made known to you everything I have learnt from my
    Father. You did not choose me, no, I chose you; and I commissioned you to go
