    Throughout the earth men spoke the same language, with the same vocabulary.
    Now as they moved eastwards they found a plain in the land of Shinar where
    they settled. They said to one another, 'Come, let us make bricks and bake
    them in the fire'. - For stone they used bricks, and for mortar they used
    bitumen. - 'Come,' they said 'let us build ourselves a town and a tower with
    its top reaching heaven. Let us make a name for ourselves, so that we may
    not be scattered about the whole earth.' Now the Lord came down to see the
    town and the tower that the sons of man had built. 'So they are all a single
    people with a single language!' said the Lord. 'This is but the start of
    their undertakings! There will be nothing too hard for them to do. Come, let
    us go down and confuse their language on the spot so that they can no longer
    understand one another.' The Lord scattered them thence over the whole face
    of the earth, and they stopped building the town. It was named Babel
    therefore, because there the Lord confused the language of the whole earth.
    It was from there that the Lord scattered them over the whole face of the
    earth.

    Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him from the mountain, saying,
    'Say this to the House of Jacob, declare this to the sons of Israel, "You
    yourselves have seen what I did with the Egyptians, how I carried you on
    eagle's wings and brought you to myself. From this you know that now, if you
    obey my voice and hold fast to my covenant, you of all the nations shall be
    my very own for all the earth is mine. I will count you a kingdom of
    priests, a consecrated nation." Those are the words you are to speak to the
    sons of Israel.' So Moses went and summoned the elders of the people,
    putting before them all that the Lord had bidden him. Then all the people
    answered as one, 'All that the Lord has said, we will do.' Now at daybreak
    on the third day there were peals of thunder on the mountain and lightning
    flashes, a dense cloud, and a loud trumpet blast, and inside the camp all
    the people trembled. Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God;
    and they stood at the bottom of the mountain. The mountain of Sinai was
    entirely wrapped in smoke, because the Lord had descended on it in the form
    of fire. Like smoke from a furnace the smoke went up, and the whole mountain
    shook violently. Louder and louder grew the sound of the trumpet. Moses
    spoke, and God answered him with peals of thunder. The Lord came down on the
    mountain of Sinai, on the mountain top, and the Lord called Moses to the top
    of the mountain.

  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    The hand of the Lord was laid on me, and he carried me away by the
    spirit of the Lord and set me down in the middle of a valley, a
    valley full of bones. He made me walk up and down among them.
    There were vast quantities of these bones on the ground the whole
    length of the valley; and they were quite dried up. He said to me,
    'Son of man, can these bones live?' I said, 'You know, Lord '. He
    said, 'Prophesy over these bones. Say, "Dry bones, hear the word
    of the Lord. The Lord says this to these bones: I am now going to
    make the breath enter you, and you will live. I shall put sinews
    on you, I shall make flesh grow on you, I shall cover you with
    skin and give you breath, and you will live; and you will learn
    that I am the Lord."' I prophesied as I had been ordered. While I
    was prophesying, there was a noise, a sound of clattering; and the
    bones joined together. I looked, and saw that they were covered
    with sinews; flesh was growing on them and skin was covering them,
    but there was no breath in them. He said to me, 'Prophesy to the
    breath; prophesy, son of man. Say to the breath, "The Lord says
    this: Come from the four winds, breath; breathe on these dead; let
    them live!"' I prophesied as he had ordered me, and the breath
    entered them; they came to life again and stood up on their feet,
    a great, an immense army. Then he said, 'Son of man, these bones
    are the whole House of Israel. They keep saying, "Our bones are
    dried up, our hope has gone; we are as good as dead". So prophesy.
    Say to them, "The Lord says this: I am now going to open your
    graves; I mean to raise you from your graves, my people, and lead
    you back to the soil of Israel. And you will know that I am the
    Lord, when I open your graves and raise you from your graves, my
    people. And I shall put my spirit in you, and you will live, and I
    shall resettle you on your own soil; and you will know that I, the
    Lord, have said and done this - it is the Lord who speaks."

    From the beginning till now the entire creation, as we know, has been
    groaning in one great act of giving birth; and not only creation, but all of
    us who possess the first-fruits of the Spirit, we too groan inwardly as we
    wait for our bodies to be set free. For we must be content to hope that we
    shall be saved - our salvation is not in sight, we should not have to be
    hoping for it if it were - but, as I say, we must hope to be saved since we
    are not saved yet - it is something we must wait for with patience. The
    Spirit too comes to help us in our weakness. For when we cannot choose words
    in order to pray properly, the Spirit himself expresses our plea in a way
    that could never be put into words, and God who knows everything in our
    hearts knows perfectly well what he means, and that the pleas of the saints
    expressed by the Spirit are according to the mind of God.

    When Pentecost day came round, the apostles had all met in one room, when
    suddenly they heard what sounded like a powerful wind from heaven, the noise
    of which filled the entire house in which they were sitting; and something
    appeared to them that seemed like tongues of fire; these separated and came
    to rest on the head of each of them. They were all filled with the Holy
    Spirit, and began to speak foreign languages as the Spirit gave them the
    gift of speech. Now there were devout men living in Jerusalem from every
    nation under heaven, and at this sound they all assembled, each one
    bewildered to hear these men speaking his own language. They were amazed and
    astonished. 'Surely' they said 'all these men speaking are Galileans? How
    does it happen that each of us hears them in his own native language?
    Parthians, Medes and Elamites; people from Mesopotamia, Judaea and
    Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of
    Libya round Cyrene; as well as visitors from Rome - Jews and proselytes
    alike - Cretans and Arabs; we hear them preaching in our own language about
    the marvels of God.'

    No one can say, 'Jesus is Lord' unless he is under the influence of the Holy
    Spirit. There is a variety of gifts but always the same Spirit; there are
    all sorts of service to be done, but always to the same Lord; working in all
    sorts of different ways in different people, it is the same God who is
    working in all of them. The particular way in which the Spirit is given to
    each person is for a good purpose. Just as a human body, though it is made
    up of many parts, is a single unit because all these parts, though many,
    make one body, so it is with Christ. In the one Spirit we were all baptised,

    If you are guided by the Spirit you will be in no danger of yielding to
    self-indulgence, since self-indulgence is the opposite of the Spirit, the
    Spirit is totally against such a thing, and it is precisely because the two
    are so opposed that you do not always carry out your good intentions. If you
    are led by the Spirit, no law can touch you. When self-indulgence is at work
    the results are obvious: fornication, gross indecency and sexual
    irresponsibility; idolatry and sorcery; feuds and wrangling, jealousy, bad
    temper and quarrels; disagreements, factions, envy; drunkenness, orgies and
    similar things. I warn you now, as I warned you before: those who behave
    like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. What the Spirit brings is
    very different: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
    trustfulness, gentleness and self-control. There can be no law against
    things like that, of course. You cannot belong to Christ Jesus unless you
    crucify all self-indulgent passions and desires. Since the Spirit is our
    life, let us be directed by the Spirit.

    People who are interested only in unspiritual things can never be pleasing
    to God. Your interests, however, are not in the unspiritual, but in the
    spiritual, since the Spirit of God has made his home in you. In fact, unless
    you possessed the Spirit of Christ you would not belong to him. Though your
    body may be dead it is because of sin, but if Christ is in you then your
    spirit is life itself because you have been justified; and if the Spirit of
    him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, then he who raised
    Jesus from the dead will give life to your own mortal bodies through his
    Spirit living in you. So then, my brothers, there is no necessity for us to
    obey our unspiritual selves or to live unspiritual lives. If you do live in
    that way, you are doomed to die; but if by the Spirit you put an end to the
    misdeeds of the body you will live. Everyone moved by the Spirit is a son of
    God. The spirit you received is not the spirit of slaves bringing fear into
    your lives again; it is the spirit of sons, and it makes us cry out, 'Abba,
    Father!' The Spirit himself and our spirit bear united witness that we are
    children of God. And if we are children we are heirs as well: heirs of God
    and coheirs with Christ, sharing his sufferings so as to share his glory.

    In the evening of the first day of the week, the doors were closed in the
    room where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood
    among them. He said to them, 'Peace be with you', and showed them his hands
    and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Lord, and
    he said to them again, 'Peace be with you. 'As the Father sent me, so am I

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'When the Advocate comes, whom I shall send to
    you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who issues from the Father, he will
    be my witness. And you too will be witnesses, because you have been with me
    from the outset. I still have many things to say to you but they would be
    too much for you now. But when the Spirit of truth comes he will lead you to
    the complete truth, since he will not be speaking as from himself but will
    say only what he has learnt; and he will tell you of the things to come. He
    will glorify me, since all he tells you will be taken from what is mine.
    Everything the Father has is mine; that is why I said: "All he tells you
    will be taken from what is mine."'

    In the evening of the first day of the week, the doors were closed in the
    room where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood
    among them. He said to them, 'Peace be with you', and showed them his hands
    and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Lord, and
    he said to them again, 'Peace be with you. 'As the Father sent me, so am I
    sending you.' After saying this he breathed on them and said: 'Receive the
    Holy Spirit. For those whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven; for those
    whose sins you retain, they are retained.'

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'If you love me you will keep my commandments.
    I shall ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate to be with you
    for ever. 'If anyone loves me he will keep my word, and my Father will love
    him, and we shall come to him and make our home with him. Those who do not
    love me do not keep my words. And my word is not my own: it is the word of
    the one who sent me. I have said these things to you while still with you;
    but the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name,
    will teach you everything and remind you of all I have said to you.'
