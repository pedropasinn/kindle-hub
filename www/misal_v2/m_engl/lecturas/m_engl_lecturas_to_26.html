    The word of the Lord was addressed to me as follows: You object, "What the
    Lord does is unjust". Listen, you House of Israel: is what I do unjust? Is
    it not what you do that is unjust? &nbsp;When the upright man renounces his
    integrity to commit sin and dies because of this, he dies because of the
    evil that he himself has committed. &nbsp;When the sinner renounces sin to
    become law-abiding and honest, he deserves to live. &nbsp;He has chosen to
    renounce all his previous sins; he shall certainly live; he shall not die.

    If our life in Christ means anything to you, if love can persuade at all, or
    the Spirit that we have in common, or any tenderness and sympathy,
    &nbsp;then be united in your convictions and united in your love, with a
    common purpose and a common mind. That is the one thing which would make me
    completely happy. &nbsp;There must be no competition among you, no conceit;
    but everybody is to be self-effacing. Always consider the other person to be
    better than yourself, &nbsp;So that nobody thinks of his own interests first
    but everybody thinks of other people's interests instead. &nbsp;In your
    minds you must be the same as Christ Jesus: &nbsp;His state was divine, yet
    he did not cling to his equality with God &nbsp;but emptied himself to
    assume the condition of a slave, and became as men are; and being as all men
    are, &nbsp;he was humbler yet, even to accepting death, death on a cross.
    &nbsp;But God raised him high and gave him the name which is above all other
    names &nbsp;so that all beings in the heavens, on earth and in the
    underworld, should bend the knee at the name of Jesus &nbsp;and that every
    tongue should acclaim Jesus Christ as Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

    Jesus said to the chief priests and the elders of the people: 'What is your
    opinion? A man had two sons. He went and said to the first, "My boy, you go
    and work in the vineyard today". &nbsp;He answered, "I will not go", but
    afterwards thought better of it and went. &nbsp;The man then went and said
    the same thing to the second who answered, "Certainly, sir", but did not go.
    &nbsp;Which of the two did the father's will?' 'The first' they said. Jesus
    said to them, 'I tell you solemnly, tax collectors and prostitutes are
    making their way into the kingdom of God before you. &nbsp;For John came to
    you, a pattern of true righteousness, but you did not believe him, and yet

    The Lord came down in the Cloud. He spoke with Moses, but took some of the
    spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. When the spirit
    came on them they prophesied, but not again. &nbsp;Two men had stayed back
    in the camp; one was called Eldad and the other Medad. The spirit came down
    on them; though they had not gone to the Tent, their names were enrolled
    among the rest. These began to prophesy in the camp. &nbsp;The young man ran
    to tell this to Moses, 'Look,' he said 'Eldad and Medad are prophesying in

    John said to Jesus, 'Master, we saw a man who is not one of us casting out
    devils in your name; and because he was not one of us we tried to stop him'.
    &nbsp;But Jesus said, 'You must not stop him: no one who works a miracle in
    my name is likely to speak evil of me. &nbsp;Anyone who is not against us is
    for us. &nbsp;'If anyone gives you a cup of water to drink just because you
    belong to Christ, then I tell you solemnly, he will most certainly not lose
    his reward.' &nbsp;'But anyone who is an obstacle to bring down one of these
    little ones who have faith, would be better thrown into the sea with a great
    millstone round his neck. &nbsp;And if your hand should cause you to sin,
    cut it off; it is better for you to enter into life crippled, than to have
    two hands and go to hell, into the fire that cannot be put out. &nbsp;And if
    your foot should cause you to sin, cut it off; it is better for you to enter
    into life lame, than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. &nbsp;And if

    Jesus said to the Pharisees: 'There was a rich man who used to dress in
    purple and fine linen and feast magnificently every day. &nbsp;And at his
    gate there lay a poor man called Lazarus, covered with sores, &nbsp;who
    longed to fill himself with the scraps that fell from the rich man's table.
    Dogs even came and licked his sores. &nbsp;Now the poor man died and was
    carried away by the angels to the bosom of Abraham. The rich man also died
    and was buried. &nbsp;'In his torment in Hades he looked up and saw Abraham
    a long way off with Lazarus in his bosom. &nbsp;So he cried out, "Father
    Abraham, pity me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and
    cool my tongue, for I am in agony in these flames". &nbsp;"My son," Abraham
    replied "remember that during your life good things came your way, just as
    bad things came the way of Lazarus. Now he is being comforted here while you
    are in agony. &nbsp;But that is not all: between us and you a great gulf has
    been fixed, to stop anyone, if he wanted to, crossing from our side to
    yours, and to stop any crossing from your side to ours." &nbsp;'The rich man
    replied, "Father, I beg you then to send Lazarus to my father's house,
    &nbsp;since I have five brothers, to give them warning so that they do not
    come to this place of torment too". &nbsp;"They have Moses and the
    prophets," said Abraham "let them listen to them.". &nbsp;"Ah no, father
    Abraham," said the rich man "but if someone comes to them from the dead,
    they will repent." &nbsp;Then Abraham said to him, "If they will not listen
    either to Moses or to the prophets, they will not be convinced even if
    someone should rise from the dead".'

    A reading from the Book of Job<span class="alindcha">1:6-22</span>
  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    One day the Sons of God came to attend on the Lord, and among them was
    Satan. &nbsp;So the Lord said to Satan, 'Where have you been?' 'Round the
    earth, 'he answered 'roaming about.' &nbsp;So the Lord asked him, 'Did you
    notice my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth: a sound and
    honest man who fears God and shuns evil.' &nbsp;'Yes,' Satan said 'but Job
    is not God-fearing for nothing, is he? &nbsp;Have you not put a wall round
    him and his house and all his domain? You have blessed all he undertakes,
    and his flocks throng the countryside. &nbsp;But stretch out your hand and
    lay a finger on his possessions: I warrant you, he will curse you to your
    face.' &nbsp;'Very well,' the Lord said to Satan 'all he has is in your
    power. But keep your hands off his person.' So Satan left the presence of
    the Lord. &nbsp;On the day when Job's sons and daughters were at their meal
    and drinking wine at their eldest brother's house, &nbsp;a messenger came to
    Job. 'Your oxen' he said 'were at the plough, with the donkeys grazing at
    their side, &nbsp;when the Sabaeans swept down on them and carried them off.
    Your servants they put to the sword: I alone escaped to tell you.' &nbsp;He
    had not finished speaking when another messenger arrived. 'The fire of God'
    he said 'has fallen from the heavens and burnt up all your sheep, and your
    shepherds too: I alone escaped to tell you.' &nbsp;He had not finished
    speaking when another messenger arrived. 'The Chaldaeans,' he said 'three
    bands of them, have raided your camels and made off with them. Your servants
    they put to the sword: I alone escaped to tell you.' &nbsp;He had not
    finished speaking when another messenger arrived. 'Your sons and daughters'
    he said 'were at their meal and drinking wine at their eldest brother's
    house, &nbsp;when suddenly from the wilderness a gale sprang up, and it
    battered all four corners of the house which fell in on the young people.
    They are dead: I alone escaped to tell you.' &nbsp;Job rose and tore his
    gown and shaved his head. Then falling to the ground he worshipped &nbsp;and
    said: 'Naked I came from my mother's womb, naked I shall return. the Lord
    gave, the Lord has taken back. Blessed be the name of the Lord!' &nbsp;In
    all this misfortune Job committed no sin nor offered any insult to God.

    An argument started between them about which of them was the greatest.
    &nbsp;Jesus knew what thoughts were going through their minds, and he took a
    little child and set him by his side &nbsp;and then said to them, 'Anyone
    who welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and anyone who
    welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For the least among you all, that
    is the one who is great.' &nbsp;John spoke up. 'Master,' he said 'we saw a
    man casting out devils in your name, and because he is not with us we tried
    to stop him.' &nbsp;But Jesus said to him, 'You must not stop him: anyone
    who is not against you is for you'.

    Job broke the silence and cursed the day of his birth. &nbsp;This is what he
    said: &nbsp;May the day perish when I was born, and the night that told of a
    boy conceived. &nbsp;Why did I not die new-born, not perish as I left the
    womb? &nbsp;Why were there two knees to receive me, two breasts for me to
    suck? &nbsp;Had there not been, I should now be lying in peace, wrapped in a
    restful slumber, &nbsp;with the kings and high viziers of earth who build
    themselves vast vaults, &nbsp;or with princes who have gold to spare and
    houses crammed with silver. &nbsp;Or put away like a still-born child that
    never came to be, like unborn babes that never see the light. &nbsp;Down
    there, bad men bustle no more, there the weary rest. &nbsp;Why give light to
    a man of grief? Why give life to those bitter of heart, &nbsp;who long for a
    death that never comes, and hunt for it more than for a buried treasure?
    &nbsp;They would be glad to see the grave-mound and shout with joy if they
    reached the tomb. &nbsp;Why make this gift of light to a man who does not
    see his way, whom God baulks on every side?

    As the time drew near for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely
    took the road for Jerusalem&nbsp;and sent messengers ahead of him. These set
    out, and they went into a Samaritan village to make preparations for him,
    &nbsp;but the people would not receive him because he was making for
    Jerusalem. &nbsp;Seeing this, the disciples James and John said, 'Lord, do

    In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, the wine
    being my concern, I took up the wine and offered it to the king. Now I had
    never been downcast before. &nbsp;So the king said, 'Why is your face so
    sad? You are not sick, surely? This must be a sadness of the heart.' A great
    fear came over me &nbsp;and I said to the king, 'May the king live for ever!
    How could my face be other than sad when the city where the tombs of my
    ancestors are lies in ruins, and its gates have been burnt down?'
    &nbsp;'What' the king asked 'is your request?' I called on the God of heaven
    &nbsp;and made this reply to the king, 'If it pleases the king, and if you
    are satisfied with your servant, give me leave to go to Judah, to the city
    of my ancestors' tombs, and rebuild it'. &nbsp;The king, with the queen
    sitting there beside him, said, 'How long will your journey take, and when
    will you return?' So I named a date that seemed acceptable to the king and
    he gave me leave to go. &nbsp;I spoke to the king once more, 'If it please
    the king, could letters be given me for the governors of Transeuphrates to
    allow me to pass through to Judah? &nbsp;And also a letter for Asaph, keeper
    of the king's park, to supply me with timber for the gates of the citadel of
    the Temple, for the city walls and for the house I am to occupy?' This the
    king granted me, for the kindly favour of my God was with me.

    Job spoke to his friends. &nbsp;Indeed, I know it is as you say: how can man
    be in the right against God? &nbsp;If any were so rash as to challenge him
    for reasons, one in a thousand would be more than they could answer.
    &nbsp;His heart is wise, and his strength is great: who then can
    successfully defy him? &nbsp;He moves the mountains, though they do not know
    it; he throws them down when he is angry. &nbsp;He shakes the earth, and
    moves it from its place, making all its pillars tremble. &nbsp;The sun, at
    his command, forbears to rise, and on the stars he sets a seal. &nbsp;He and
    no other stretched out the skies, and trampled the Sea's tall waves.
    &nbsp;The Bear, Orion too, are of his making, the Pleiades and the Mansions
    of the South. &nbsp;His works are great, beyond all reckoning, his marvels,
    past all counting. &nbsp;Were he to pass me, I should not see him, nor
    detect his stealthy movement. &nbsp;Were he to snatch a prize, who could
    prevent him, or dare to say, 'What are you doing?' &nbsp;How dare I plead my

  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    All the people gathered as one man on the square before the Water Gate. They
    asked Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses which the Lord
    had prescribed for Israel. &nbsp;Accordingly Ezra the priest brought the Law
    before the assembly, consisting of men, women, and children old enough to
    understand. This was the first day of the seventh month. &nbsp;On the square
    before the Water Gate, in the presence of the men and women, and children
    old enough to understand, he read from the book from early morning till
    noon; all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law. &nbsp;Ezra
    the scribe stood on a wooden dais erected for the purpose. &nbsp;In full
    view of all the people-since he stood higher than all the people-Ezra opened
    the book; and when he opened it all the people stood up. &nbsp;Then Ezra
    blessed the Lord, the great God, and all the people raised their hands and
    answered, 'Amen! Amen!'; then they bowed down and, face to the ground,
    prostrated themselves before the Lord. &nbsp;The Levites explained the Law
    to the people while the people remained standing. &nbsp;And Ezra read from
    the Law of God, translating and giving the sense, so that the people
    understood what was read. &nbsp;Then (Nehemiah-His Excellency-and) Ezra,
    priest and scribe (and the Levites who were instructing the people) said to
    all the people, 'This day is sacred to the Lord your God. Do not be
    mournful, do not weep.' For the people were all in tears as they listened to
    the words of the Law. &nbsp;He then said, 'Go, eat the fat, drink the sweet
    wine, and send a portion to the man who has nothing prepared ready. For this
    day is sacred to our Lord. Do not be sad: the joy of the Lord is your
    stronghold.' &nbsp;And the Levites calmed all the people, saying, 'Be at
    ease; this is a sacred day. Do not be sad.' &nbsp;And all the people went
    off to eat and drink and give shares away and begin to enjoy themselves
    since they had understood the meaning of what had been proclaimed to them.

    them, 'The harvest is rich but the labourers are few, so ask the Lord of the
    harvest to send labourers to his harvest. &nbsp;Start off now, but remember,
    I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. &nbsp;Carry no purse, no

    come back to you. &nbsp;Stay in the same house, taking what food and drink
    they have to offer, for the labourer deserves his wages; do not move from

    Integrity belongs to the Lord our God; to us the look of shame we wear

    &nbsp;Have you ever in your life given orders to the morning or sent the
    dawn to its post, &nbsp;telling it to grasp the earth by its edges and shake
    the wicked out of it, &nbsp;when it changes the earth to sealing clay and

    breaking the arm raised to strike? &nbsp;Have you journeyed all the way to
    the sources of the sea, or walked where the Abyss is deepest? &nbsp;Have you
    been shown the gates of Death or met the janitors of Shadowland? &nbsp;Have
    you an inkling of the extent of the earth? Tell me all about it if you have!
    &nbsp;Which is the way to the light and where does darkness live? &nbsp;You
    could show them the way to their proper places, or put them on the path to
    where they live! &nbsp;If you know all this, you must have been born with
    them, you must be very old by now! &nbsp;Job replied to the Lord: &nbsp;My

    obscured your designs with my empty-headed words. I have been holding forth
    on matters I cannot understand, on marvels beyond me and my knowledge.
    &nbsp;I knew you then only by hearsay; but now, having seen you with my own
    eyes, &nbsp;I retract all I have said, and in dust and ashes I repent.
    &nbsp;The Lord blessed Job's new fortune even more than his first one. He
    came to own fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of
    oxen and a thousand she-donkeys. &nbsp;He had seven sons and three
    daughters; &nbsp;his first daughter he called 'Turtledove', the second
    'Cassia' and the third 'Mascara'. &nbsp;Throughout the land there were no
    women as beautiful as the daughters of Job. And their father gave them
    inheritance rights like their brothers. &nbsp;After his trials, Job lived on
    until he was a hundred and forty years old, and saw his children and his
    children's children up to the fourth generation. Then Job died, an old man
    and full of days.

    The seventy-two came back rejoicing. 'Lord,' they said 'even the devils
    submit to us when we use your name.' &nbsp;He said to them, 'I watched Satan
    fall like lightning from heaven. &nbsp;Yes, I have given you power to tread
    underfoot serpents and scorpions and the whole strength of the enemy;
    nothing shall ever hurt you. &nbsp;Yet do not rejoice that the spirits
    submit to you; rejoice rather that your names are written in heaven.'
    &nbsp;It was then that, filled with joy by the Holy Spirit, he said, 'I
    bless you, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, for hiding these things from
    the learned and the clever and revealing them to mere children. Yes, Father,
    for that is what it pleased you to do. &nbsp;Everything has been entrusted
    to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and
    who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal
    him.' &nbsp;Then turning to his disciples he spoke to them in private,
    'Happy the eyes that see what you see, &nbsp;for I tell you that many
    prophets and kings wanted to see what you see, and never saw it; to hear
    what you hear, and never heard it'.
