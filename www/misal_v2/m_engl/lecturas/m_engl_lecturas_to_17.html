    The Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream and said, 'Ask what you would like
    me to give you'. Solomon replied, ‘Lord my God, you have made your servant
    king in succession to David my father. But I am a very young man, unskilled
    in leadership. Your servant finds himself in the midst of this people of
    yours that you have chosen, a people so many its number cannot be counted or
    reckoned. Give your servant a heart to understand how to discern between
    good and evil, for who could govern this people of yours that is so great?'
    It pleased the Lord that Solomon should have asked for this. 'Since you have
    asked for this' the Lord said 'and not asked for long life for yourself or
    riches or the lives of your enemies, but have asked for a discerning
    judgment for yourself, here and now I do what you ask. I give you a heart
    wise and shrewd as none before you has had and none will have after you.

    Jesus said to the crowds: 'The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in
    a field which someone has found; he hides it again, goes off happy, sells
    everything he owns and buys the field. 'Again, the kingdom of heaven is like
    a merchant looking for fine pearls; when he finds one of great value he goes
    and sells everything he owns and buys it. 'Again, the kingdom of heaven is
    like a dragnet cast into the sea that brings in a haul of all kinds. When it
    is full, the fishermen haul it ashore; then, sitting down, they collect the
    good ones in a basket and throw away those that are no use. This is how it
    will be at the end of time: the angels will appear and separate the wicked
    from the just to throw them into the blazing furnace where there will be
    weeping and grinding of teeth. 'Have you understood all this?' They said,
    'Yes'. And he said to them, 'Well then, every scribe who becomes a disciple
    of the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out from his
    storeroom things both new and old'.

    Jesus went off to the other side of the Sea of Galilee - or of Tiberias -
    and a large crowd followed him, impressed by the signs he gave by curing the
    sick. Jesus climbed the hillside, and sat down there with his disciples. It
    was shortly before the Jewish feast of Passover. Looking up, Jesus saw the
    crowds approaching and said to Philip, 'Where can we buy some bread for
    these people to eat?' He only said this to test Philip; he himself knew
    exactly what he was going to do. Philip answered, 'Two hundred denarii would
    only buy enough to give them a small piece each'. One of his disciples,
    Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said, 'There is a small boy here with five
    barley loaves and two fish; but what is that between so many?' Jesus said to
    them, 'Make the people sit down'. There was plenty of grass there, and as
    many as five thousand men sat down. Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks,
    and gave them out to all who were sitting ready; he then did the same with
    the fish, giving out as much as was wanted. When they had eaten enough he
    said to the disciples, 'Pick up the pieces left over, so that nothing gets
    wasted'. So they picked them up, and filled twelve hampers with scraps left
    over from the meal of five barley loaves. The people, seeing this sign that
    he had given, said, 'This really is the prophet who is to come into the
    world'. Jesus, who could see they were about to come and take him by force
    and make him king, escaped back to the hills by himself.

    The Lord said, 'How great an outcry there is against Sodom and Gomorrah! How
    grievous is their sin! I propose to go down and see whether or not they have
    done all that is alleged in the outcry against them that has come up to me.
    I am determined to know.' The men left there and went to Sodom while Abraham
    remained standing before the Lord. Approaching him he said, 'Are you really
    going to destroy the just man with the sinner? Perhaps there are fifty just
    men in the town. Will you really overwhelm them, will you not spare the
    place for the fifty just men in it? Do not think of doing such a thing: to
    kill the just man with the sinner, treating just and sinner alike! Do not
    think of it! Will the judge of the whole earth not administer justice?' The
    Lord replied, 'If at Sodom I find fifty just men in the town, I will spare
    the whole place because of them'. Abraham replied, 'I am bold indeed to
    speak like this to my Lord, I who am dust and ashes. But perhaps the fifty
    just men lack five: will you destroy the whole city for five?' 'No,' he
    replied 'I will not destroy it if I find forty five just men there.' Again
    Abraham said to him, 'Perhaps there will only be forty there'. 'I will not
    do it' he replied 'for the sake of the forty.' Abraham said, 'I trust my
    Lord will not be angry, but give me leave to speak: perhaps there will only
    be thirty there'. 'I will not do it' he replied 'if I find thirty there.' He
    said, 'I am bold indeed to speak like this, but perhaps there will only be
    twenty there'. 'I will not destroy it' he replied 'for the sake of the
    twenty.' He said, 'I trust my Lord will not be angry if I speak once more:

    Once Jesus was in a certain place praying, and when he had finished one of
    his disciples said, 'Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his
    disciples'. He said to them, 'Say this when you pray: "Father, may your name
    be held holy, your kingdom come; give us each day our daily bread, and
    forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive each one who is in debt to us.
    And do not put us to the test."' He also said to them, 'Suppose one of you
    has a friend and goes to him in the middle of the night to say, "My friend,
    lend me three loaves, because a friend of mine on his travels has just
    arrived at my house and I have nothing to offer him"; and the man answers
    from inside the house, "Do not bother me. The door is bolted now, and my
    children and I are in bed; I cannot get up to give it you". I tell you, if
    the man does not get up and give it him for friendship's sake, persistence
    will be enough to make him get up and give his friend all he wants. 'So I
    say to you: Ask, and it will be given to you; search, and you will find;
    knock, and the door will be opened to you. For the one who asks always
    receives; the one who searches always finds; the one who knocks will always
    have the door opened to him. What father among you would hand his son a
    stone when he asked for bread? Or hand him a snake instead of a fish? Or
    hand him a scorpion if he asked for an egg? If you then, who are evil, know
    how to give your children what is good, how much more will the heavenly
    Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!'

    Moses made his way back down the mountain with the two tablets of the
    Testimony in his hands, tablets inscribed on both sides, inscribed on the
    front and on the back. These tablets were the work of God, and the writing
    on them was God's writing engraved on the tablets. Joshua heard the noise of
    the people shouting. 'There is the sound of battle in the camp', he told
    Moses. Moses answered him: 'No song of victory is this sound, no wailing for
    defeat this sound; it is the sound of chanting that I hear'. As he
    approached the camp and saw the calf and the groups dancing, Moses' anger
    blazed. He threw down the tablets he was holding and broke them at the foot
    of the mountain. He seized the calf they had made and burned it, grinding it
    into powder which he scattered on the water; and he made the sons of Israel
    drink it. To Aaron Moses said, 'What has this people done to you, for you to
    bring such a great sin on them?' 'Let not my lord's anger blaze like this'
    Aaron answered. 'You know yourself how prone this people is to evil. They
    said to me, "Make us a god to go at our head; this Moses, the man who
    brought us up from Egypt, we do not know what has become of him". So I said
    to them, "Who has gold?", and they took it off and brought it to me. I threw
    it into the fire and out came this calf.' On the following day Moses said to
    the people, 'You have committed a grave sin. But now I shall go up to the
    Lord: perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.' And Moses returned to the
    Lord. 'I am grieved,' he cried 'this people has committed a grave sin,
    making themselves a god of gold. And yet, if it pleased you to forgive this
    sin of theirs...! But if not, then blot me out from the book that you have
    written.' The Lord answered Moses, 'It is the man who has sinned against me
    that I shall blot out from my book. Go now, lead the people to the place of
    which I told you. My angel shall go before you but, on the day of my
    visitation, I shall punish them for their sin.'

    The Lord said this to me, 'Go and buy a linen loincloth and put it round
    your waist. But do not dip it in water.' And so, as the Lord had ordered, I
    bought a loincloth and put it round my waist. A second time the word of the
    Lord was spoken to me, 'Take the loincloth that you have bought and are
    wearing round your waist; up! Go to the Euphrates and hide it in a hole in
    the rock.' So I went and hid it near the Euphrates as the Lord had ordered
    me. Many days afterwards the Lord said to me, 'Get up and go to the
    Euphrates and fetch the loincloth I ordered you to hide there'. So I went to
    the Euphrates, and I searched, and I took the loincloth from the place where
    I had hidden it. The loincloth was spoilt, good for nothing. Then the word
    of the Lord was addressed to me, 'Thus says the Lord: In the same way I will
    spoil the arrogance of Judah and Jerusalem. This evil people who refuse to
    listen to my words, who follow the dictates of their own hard hearts, who
    have followed alien gods, and served them and worshipped them, let them
    become like this loincloth, good for nothing. For just as a loincloth clings
    to a man's waist, so I had intended the whole House of Judah to cling to me
    - it is the Lord who speaks - to be my people, my glory, my honour and my
    boast. But they have not listened.

    Jesus put a parable before the crowds, 'The kingdom of heaven is like a
    mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field. It is the smallest of
    all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the biggest shrub of all and
    becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and shelter in its
    branches.' He told them another parable, 'The kingdom of heaven is like the
    yeast a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour till it was
    leavened all through'. In all this Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables;
    indeed, he would never speak to them except in parables. This was to fulfill
    the prophecy: I will speak to you in parables and expound things hidden
    since the foundation of the world.

    Moses used to take the Tent and pitch it outside the camp; at some distance
    from the camp. He called it the Tent of Meeting. Anyone who had to consult
    the Lord would go out to the Tent of Meeting, outside the camp. Whenever
    Moses went out to the Tent, all the people would rise. Every man would stand
    at the door of his tent and watch Moses until he reached the Tent; the
    pillar of cloud would come down and station itself at the entrance to the
    Tent, and the Lord would speak with Moses. When they saw the pillar of cloud
    stationed at the entrance to the Tent, all the people would rise and bow
    low, each at the door of his tent. The Lord would speak with Moses face to
    face, as a man speaks with his friend. Then Moses would turn back to the
    camp, but the young man who was his servant, Joshua son of Nun, would not
    leave the Tent. Moses called on the name of the Lord. The Lord passed before
    him and proclaimed, 'The Lord, the Lord, a God of tenderness and compassion,
    slow to anger, rich in kindness and faithfulness; for thousands he maintains
    his kindness, forgives faults, transgression, sin; yet he lets nothing go
    unchecked, punishing the father's fault in the sons and in the grandsons to
    the third and fourth generation'. And Moses bowed down to the ground at once
    and worshipped. 'If I have indeed won your favour, Lord,' he said 'let my
    Lord come with us, I beg. True, they are a headstrong people, but forgive us
    our faults and our sins, and adopt us as your heritage.' He stayed there
    with the Lord for forty days and forty nights, eating and drinking nothing.
    He inscribed on the tablets the words of the Covenant - the Ten Words.

    Leaving the crowds, Jesus went to the house, and his disciples came to him
    and said, 'Explain the parable about the darnel in the field to us'. He said
    in reply, 'The sower of the good seed is the Son of Man.13:38 The field is
    the world; the good seed is the subjects of the kingdom; the darnel, the
    subjects of the evil one; the enemy who sowed them, the devil; the harvest
    is the end of the world; the reapers are the angels. Well then, just as the
    darnel is gathered up and burnt in the fire, so it will be at the end of
    time. The Son of Man will send his angels and they will gather out of his
    kingdom all things that provoke offences and all who do evil, and throw them
    into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.

    Moses did this; he did exactly as the Lord had directed him. The tabernacle
    was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year. Moses
    erected the tabernacle. He fixed the sockets for it, put up its frames, put
    its crossbars in position, set up its posts. He spread the tent over the
    tabernacle and on top of this the covering for the tent, as the Lord had
    directed Moses. He took the Testimony and placed it inside the ark. He set
    the shafts to the ark and placed the throne of mercy on it. He brought the
    ark into the tabernacle and put the screening veil in place; thus he
    screened the ark of the Lord, as the Lord had directed Moses. The cloud
    covered the Tent of Meeting and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
    Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting because of the cloud that rested
    on it and because of the glory of the Lord that filled the tabernacle. At
    every stage of their journey, whenever the cloud rose from the tabernacle
    the sons of Israel would resume their march. If the cloud did not rise, they
    waited and would not march until it did. For the cloud of the Lord rested on
    the tabernacle by day, and a fire shone within the cloud by night, for all
    the House of Israel to see. And so it was for every stage of their journey.

    Jesus said to the crowds: 'Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet
    cast into the sea that brings in a haul of all kinds. When it is full, the
    fishermen haul it ashore; then, sitting down, they collect the good ones in
    a basket and throw away those that are no use. This is how it will be at the
    end of time: the angels will appear and separate the wicked from the just to
    throw them into the blazing furnace where there will be weeping and grinding
    of teeth. 'Have you understood all this?' They said, 'Yes'. And he said to

    At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah,
    this word was addressed to Jeremiah by the Lord, 'The Lord says this: Stand
    in the court of the Temple of the Lord. To all the people of the towns of
    Judah who come to worship in the Temple of the Lord you must speak all the
    words I have commanded you to tell them; do not omit one syllable. Perhaps
    they will listen and each turn from his evil way: if so, I shall relent and
    not bring the disaster on them which I intended for their misdeeds. Say to
    them, "The Lord says this: If you will not listen to me by following my Law
    which I put before you, by paying attention to the words of my servants the
    prophets whom I send so persistently to you, without your ever listening to
    them, I will treat this Temple as I treated Shiloh, and make this city a
    curse for all the nations of the earth".' The priests and prophets and all
    the people heard Jeremiah say these words in the Temple of the Lord. When
    Jeremiah had finished saying everything that the Lord had ordered him to say
    to all the people, the priests and prophets seized hold of him and said,
    'You shall die! Why have you made this prophecy in the name of the Lord,
    "This Temple will be like Shiloh, and this city will be desolate, and
    uninhabited"?' And the people were all crowding round Jeremiah in the Temple
    of the Lord.

    Coming to his home town, Jesus taught the people in their synagogue in such
    a way that they were astonished and said, 'Where did the man get this wisdom
    and these miraculous powers? This is the carpenter's son, surely? Is not his
    mother the woman called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon
    and Jude? His sisters, too, are they not all here with us? So where did the
    man get it all?' And they would not accept him. But Jesus said to them, 'A

    did not work many miracles there because of their lack of faith.

    weeks of years, forty-nine years. And on the tenth day of the seventh month
    you shall sound the trumpet; on the Day of Atonement you shall sound the

    sow, you will not harvest the ungathered corn, you will not gather from the
    untrimmed vine. The jubilee is to be a holy thing to you, you will eat what
    comes from the fields. "In this year of jubilee each of you is to return to
    his ancestral home. If you buy or sell with your neighbour, let no one wrong
    his brother. If you buy from your neighbour, this must take into account the
    number of years since the jubilee: according to the number of productive
    years he will fix the price. The greater the number of years, the higher
    shall be the price demanded; the less the number of years, the greater the

    bring down on you the disaster he has pronounced against you. For myself, I
    am as you see in your hands. Do whatever you please or think right with me.
    But be sure of this, that if you put me to death, you will be bringing
    innocent blood on yourselves, on this city and on its citizens, since the
    Lord has truly sent me to you to say all these words in your hearing.' The
    officials and all the people then said to the priests and prophets, 'This
    man does not deserve to die: he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our
    God'. But Jeremiah had a protector in Ahikam son of Shaphan, so he was not
    handed over to the people to be put to death.

    At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the reputation of Jesus, and
    said to his court, 'This is John the Baptist himself; he has risen from the
    dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him'. Now it was
    Herod who had arrested John, chained him up and put him in prison because of
    Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. For John had told him, 'It is against
    the Law for you to have her'. He had wanted to kill him but was afraid of
    the people, who regarded John as a prophet. Then, during the celebrations
    for Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company,
    and so delighted Herod that he promised on oath to give her anything she
    asked. Prompted by her mother she said, 'Give me John the Baptist's head,
    here, on a dish'. The king was distressed but, thinking of the oaths he had
    sworn and of his guests, he ordered it to be given her, and sent and had
    John beheaded in the prison. The head was brought in on a dish and given to
    the girl who took it to her mother. John's disciples came and took the body
    and buried it; then they went off to tell Jesus.
