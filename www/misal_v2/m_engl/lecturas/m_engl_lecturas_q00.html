    'Now, now-it is the Lord who speaks-come back to me with all your heart,
    fasting, weeping, mourning.' Let your hearts be broken, not your garments
    torn, turn to the Lord your God again, for he is all tenderness and
    compassion, slow to anger, rich in graciousness, and ready to relent. Who
    knows if he will not turn again, will not relent, will not leave a blessing
    as he passes, oblation and libation for the Lord your God? Sound the trumpet
    in Zion! Order a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly, call the people together,
    summon the community, assemble the elders, gather the children, even the
    infants at the breast. Let the bridegroom leave his bedroom and the bride
    her alcove. Between vestibule and altar let the priests, the ministers of
    the Lord, lament. Let them say, 'Spare your people, Lord! Do not make your
    heritage a thing of shame, a byword for the nations. Why should it be said
    among the nations, "Where is their God?"' Then the Lord, jealous on behalf
    of his land, took pity on his people.

    We are ambassadors for Christ; it is as though God were appealing through

    For our sake God made the sinless one into sin, so that in him we might

    to neglect the grace of God that you have received. For he says: At the

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'Be careful not to parade your good deeds
    before men to attract their notice; by doing this you will lose all reward
    from your Father in heaven. So when you give alms, do not have it trumpeted
    before you; this is what the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
    streets to win men's admiration. I tell you solemnly, they have had their
    reward. But when you give alms, your left hand must not know what your right
    is doing; your almsgiving must be secret, and your Father who sees all that
    is done in secret will reward you. 'And when you pray, do not imitate the
    hypocrites: they love to say their prayers standing up in the synagogues and
    at the street corners for people to see them; I tell you solemnly, they have
    had their reward. But when you pray, go to your private room and, when you
    have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in that secret place, and
    your Father who sees all that is done in secret will reward you. 'When you
    fast do not put on a gloomy look as the hypocrites do: they pull long faces
    to let men know they are fasting. I tell you solemnly, they have had their
    reward. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that
    no one will know you are fasting except your Father who sees all that is
    done in secret; and your Father who sees all that is done in secret will
    reward you.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'The Son of Man is destined to suffer
    grievously, to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes and
    to be put to death, and to be raised up on the third day.' Then to all he
    said, 'If anyone wants to be a follower of mine, let him renounce himself
    and take up his cross every day and follow me. For anyone who wants to save
    his life will lose it; but anyone who loses his life for my sake, that man
    will save it. What gain, then, is it for a man to have won the whole world
    and to have lost or ruined his very self?

    Thus says the Lord: Shout for all you are worth, raise your voice like a
    trumpet. Proclaim their faults to my people, their sins to the House of
    Jacob. They seek me day after day, they long to know my ways, like a nation
    that wants to act with integrity and not ignore the law of its God. They ask
    me for laws that are just, they long for God to draw near: 'Why should we
    fast if you never see it, why do penance if you never notice?' Look, you do
    business on your fastdays, you oppress all your workmen; look, you quarrel
    and squabble when you fast and strike the poor man with your fist. Fasting
    like yours today will never make your voice heard on high. Is that the sort
    of fast that pleases me, a truly penitential day for men? Hanging your head
    like a reed, lying down on sackcloth and ashes? Is that what you call
    fasting, a day acceptable to the Lord? Is not this the sort of fast that
    pleases me - it is the Lord who speaks - to break unjust fetters and undo
    the thongs of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and break every yoke,
    to share your bread with the hungry, and shelter the homeless poor, to
    clothe the man you see to be naked and not turn from your own kin? Then will
    your light shine like the dawn and your wound be quickly healed over. Your
    integrity will go before you and the glory of the Lord behind you. Cry, and
    the Lord will answer; call, and he will say, 'I am here'.
