    The Pharisees went away to work out between them how to trap Jesus in what
    he said. &nbsp;And they sent their disciples to him, together with the
    Herodians, to say, 'Master, we know that you are an honest man and teach the
    way of God in an honest way, and that you are not afraid of anyone, because
    a man's rank means nothing to you. &nbsp;Tell us your opinion, then. Is it
    permissible to pay taxes to Caesar or not?' &nbsp;But Jesus was aware of
    their malice and replied, 'You hypocrites! Why do you set this trap for me?
    &nbsp;Let me see the money you pay the tax with.' They handed him a
    denarius, &nbsp;and he said, 'Whose head is this? Whose name?'
    &nbsp;'Caesar's' they replied. He then said to them, 'Very well, give back
    to Caesar what belongs to Caesar - and to God what belongs to God'.

    James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached Jesus. 'Master,' they said
    to him 'we want you to do us a favour.' &nbsp;He said to them, 'What is it
    you want me to do for you?' &nbsp;They said to him, 'Allow us to sit one at
    your right hand and the other at your left in your glory'. &nbsp;'You do not
    know what you are asking' Jesus said to them. 'Can you drink the cup that I
    must drink, or be baptised with the baptism with which I must be baptised?'
    &nbsp;They replied, 'We can'. Jesus said to them, 'The cup that I must drink
    you shall drink, and with the baptism with which I must be baptised you
    shall be baptised, &nbsp;but as for seats at my right hand or my left, these
    are not mine to grant; they belong to those to whom they have been
    allotted'. &nbsp;When the other ten heard this they began to feel indignant
    with James and John, &nbsp;so Jesus called them to him and said to them,
    'You know that among the pagans their so-called rulers lord it over them,
    and their great men make their authority felt. &nbsp;This is not to happen
    among you. No; anyone who wants to become great among you must be your

    Amalek. I, meanwhile, will stand on the hilltop, the staff of God in my

    You must keep to what you have been taught and know to be true; remember who
    your teachers were, &nbsp;and how, ever since you were a child, you have
    known the holy scriptures - from these you can learn the wisdom that leads

    Jesus told his disciples a parable about the need to pray continually and
    never lose heart. &nbsp;'There was a judge in a certain town' he said 'who
    had neither fear of God nor respect for man. &nbsp;In the same town there
    was a widow who kept on coming to him and saying, "I want justice from you
    against my enemy!"&nbsp;For a long time he refused, but at last he said to
    himself, "Maybe I have neither fear of God nor respect for man, &nbsp;but
    since she keeps pestering me I must give this widow her just rights, or she
    will persist in coming and worry me to death".' &nbsp;And the Lord said 'You
    notice what the unjust judge has to say? &nbsp;Now will not God see justice
    done to his chosen who cry to him day and night even when he delays to help
    them? &nbsp;I promise you, he will see justice done to them, and done

    You were dead, through the crimes and the sins in which you used to
    live&nbsp; when you were following the way of this world, obeying the ruler
    who governs the air the spirit who is at work in the rebellious. We all were
    among them too in the past, living sensual lives, ruled entirely by our own
    physical desires and our own ideas; so that by nature we were as much under
    God's anger as the rest of the world. But God loved us with so much love
    that he was generous with his mercy: when we were dead through our sins, he
    brought us to life with Christ-it is through grace that you have been saved-
    and raised us up with him and gave us a place with him in heaven, in Christ
    Jesus. This was to show for all ages to come, through his goodness towards
    us in Christ Jesus, how infinitely rich he is in grace. Because it is by
    grace that you have been saved, through faith; not by anything of your own,
    but by a gift from God; not by anything that you have done, so that nobody
    can claim the credit. We are God's work of art, created in Christ Jesus to
    live the good life as from the beginning he had meant us to live it.

    A man in the crowd said to Jesus, 'Master, tell my brother to give me a
    share of our inheritance.'He said to him, 'My friend, who appointed me your
    judge, or the arbitrator of your claims?'Then he said to them, 'Watch, and
    be on your guard against avarice of any kind, for life does not consist in
    possessions, even when someone has more than he needs.'Then he told them a
    parable, 'There was once a rich man who, having had a good harvest from his
    land,thought to himself, "What am I to do? I have not enough room to store
    my crops."Then he said, "This is what I will will pull down my barns and
    build bigger ones, and store all my grain and my goods in them,and I will
    say to my soul: My soul, you have plenty of good things laid by for many
    years to come; take things easy, eat, drink, have a good time."But God said
    to him, "Fool! This very night the demand will be made for your soul; and
    this hoard of yours, whose will it be then?"So it is when someone stores up
    treasure for himself instead of becoming rich in the sight of God.'

    Sin entered the world through one man, and through sin death, and thus death
    has spread through the whole human race because everyone has sinned.
    &nbsp;If it is certain that through one man's fall so many died, it is even
    more certain that divine grace, coming through the one man, Jesus Christ,
    came to so many as an abundant free gift. &nbsp;If it is certain that death
    reigned over everyone as the consequence of one man's fall, it is even more
    certain that one man, Jesus Christ, will cause everyone to reign in life who
    receives the free gift that he does not deserve, of being made righteous.
    &nbsp;Again, as one man's fall brought condemnation on everyone, so the good
    act of one man brings everyone life and makes them justified. &nbsp;As by
    one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by one man's obedience
    many will be made righteous. &nbsp;But however great the number of sins
    committed, grace was even greater; &nbsp;and so, just as sin reigned
    wherever there was death, so grace will reign to bring eternal life thanks
    to the righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ our Lord.

    Do not forget, I say, that you had no Christ and were excluded from
    membership of Israel, aliens with no part in the covenants with their
    Promise; you were immersed in this world, without hope and without God.
    &nbsp;But now in Christ Jesus, you that used to be so far apart from us have
    been brought very close, by the blood of Christ. &nbsp;For he is the peace
    between us, and has made the two into one and broken down the barrier which
    used to keep them apart, actually destroying in his own person the hostility
    &nbsp;caused by the rules and decrees of the Law. This was to create one
    single New Man in himself out of the two of them and by restoring peace
    &nbsp;through the cross, to unite them both in a single Body and reconcile
    them with God; In his own person he killed the hostility. &nbsp;Later he
    came to bring the good news of peace, peace to you who were far away and
    peace to those who were near at hand. &nbsp;Through him, both of us have in
    the one Spirit our way to come to the Father. &nbsp;So you are no longer
    aliens or foreign visitors: you are citizens like all the saints, and part
    of God's household. &nbsp;You are part of a building that has the apostles
    and prophets for its foundations, and Christ Jesus himself for its main
    cornerstone. &nbsp;As every structure is aligned on him, all grow into one
    holy temple in the Lord; &nbsp;and you too, in him, are being built into a
    house where God lives, in the Spirit.

    You have probably heard how I have been entrusted by God with the grace he
    meant for you, &nbsp;and that it was by a revelation that I was given the
    knowledge of the mystery, as I have just described it very shortly. &nbsp;If
    you read my word you will have some idea of the depths that I see in the
    mystery of Christ. &nbsp;This that has now been revealed through the Spirit
    to his holy apostles and prophets was unknown to any men in past
    generations; &nbsp;it means that pagans now share the same inheritance, that
    they are parts of the same body, and that the same promise has been made to
    them, in Jesus Christ, through the gospel. &nbsp;I have been made the
    servant of that gospel by a gift of grace from God who gave it to me by his
    own power. &nbsp;I, who am less than the least of all the saints have been
    entrusted with this special grace, not only of proclaiming to the pagans the
    infinite treasure of Christ &nbsp;but also of explaining how the mystery is
    to be dispensed. Through all the ages, this has been kept hidden in God, the
    creator of everything. Why? &nbsp;So that the Sovereignties and Powers
    should learn only now, through the Church, how comprehensive God's wisdom

    Jesus said to his disciples: You may be quite sure of this, that if the
    householder had known at what hour the burglar would come, he would not have
    let anyone break through the wall of his house. &nbsp;You too must stand
    ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.'
    &nbsp;Peter said, 'Lord, do you mean this parable for us, or for everyone?'
    &nbsp;The Lord replied, 'What sort of steward, then, is faithful and wise
    enough for the master to place him over his household to give them their
    allowance of food at the proper time? &nbsp;Happy that servant if his
    master's arrival finds him at this employment. &nbsp;I tell you truly, he
    will place him over everything he owns. &nbsp;But as for the servant who
    says to himself, "My master is taking his time coming", and sets about
    beating the menservants and the maids, and eating and drinking and getting
    drunk, &nbsp;his master will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour
    he does not know. The master will cut him off and send him to the same fate
    as the unfaithful. &nbsp;The servant who knows what his master wants, but
    has not even started to carry out those wishes, will receive very many
    strokes of the lash. &nbsp;The one who did not know, but deserves to be
    beaten for what he has done, will receive fewer strokes. When a man has had
    a great deal given him, a great deal will be demanded of him; when a man has
    had a great deal given him on trust, even more will be expected of him.

    that sort of behaviour ends in death. &nbsp;Now, however, you have been set
    free from sin, you have been made slaves of God, and you get a reward
    leading to your sanctification and ending in eternal life. &nbsp;For the
    wage paid by sin is death; the present given by God is eternal life in
    Christ Jesus our Lord.

    The reason why those who are in Christ Jesus are not condemned, &nbsp;is
    that the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the
    law of sin and death. &nbsp;God has done what the Law, because of our
    unspiritual nature, was unable to do. God dealt with sin by sending his own
    Son in a body as physical as any sinful body, and in that body God condemned
    sin. &nbsp;He did this in order that the Law's just demands might be
    satisfied in us, who behave not as our unspiritual nature but as the spirit
    dictates. &nbsp;The unspiritual are interested only in what is unspiritual,
    but the spiritual are interested in spiritual things. &nbsp;It is death to
    limit oneself to what is unspiritual; life and peace can only come with
    concern for the spiritual. &nbsp;That is because to limit oneself to what is
    unspiritual is to be at enmity with God: such a limitation never could and
    never does submit to God's law. &nbsp;People who are interested only in
    unspiritual things can never be pleasing to God. &nbsp;Your interests,
    however, are not in the unspiritual, but in the spiritual, since the Spirit
    of God has made his home in you. In fact, unless you possessed the Spirit of
    Christ you would not belong to him. &nbsp;Though your body may be dead it is
    because of sin, but if Christ is in you then your spirit is life itself
    because you have been justified; &nbsp;and if the Spirit of him who raised
    Jesus from the dead is living in you, then he who raised Jesus from the dead
    will give life to your own mortal bodies through his Spirit living in you.

    Each one of us has been given his own share of grace, given as Christ
    allotted it. &nbsp;It was said that he would: When he ascended to the
    height, he captured prisoners, he gave gifts to men. &nbsp;When it says, 'he
    ascended', what can it mean if not that he descended right down to the lower
    regions of the earth? &nbsp;The one who rose higher than all the heavens to
    fill all things is none other than the one who descended. &nbsp;And to some,
    his gift was that they should be apostles; to some, prophets; to some,
    evangelists; to some, pastors and teachers; &nbsp;so that the saints
    together make a unity in the work of service, building up the body of
    Christ. &nbsp;In this way we are all to come to unity in our faith and in
    our knowledge of the Son of God, until we become the perfect Man, fully
    mature with the fullness of Christ himself. &nbsp;Then we shall not be
    children any longer, or tossed one way and another and carried along by
    every wind of doctrine, at the mercy of all the tricks men play and their
    cleverness in practicing deceit. &nbsp;If we live by the truth and in love,
    we shall grow in all ways into Christ, who is the head &nbsp;by whom the
    whole body is fitted and joined together, every joint adding its own
    strength, for each separate part to work according to its function. So the
    body grows until it has built itself up, in love.

    It was just about this time that some people arrived and told Jesus about
    the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with that of their sacrifices.
    &nbsp;At this he said to them, 'Do you suppose these Galileans who suffered
    like that were greater sinners than any other Galileans? &nbsp;They were
    not, I tell you. No; but unless you repent you will all perish as they did.
    &nbsp;Or those eighteen on whom the tower at Siloam fell and killed them? Do
    you suppose that they were more guilty than all the other people living in
    Jerusalem? &nbsp;They were not, I tell you. No; but unless you repent you
    will all perish as they did.' &nbsp;He told this parable: 'A man had a fig
    tree planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it but found
    none. &nbsp;He said to the man who looked after the vineyard, "Look here,
    for three years now I have been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree
    and finding none. Cut it down: why should it be taking up the ground?"
    &nbsp;"Sir," the man replied "leave it one more year and give me time to dig
    round it and manure it: &nbsp;it may bear fruit next year; if not, then you
    can cut it down."'
