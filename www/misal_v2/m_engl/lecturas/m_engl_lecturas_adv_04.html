    The Lord spoke to Ahaz and said, 'Ask the Lord your God for a sign for
    yourself coming either from the depths of Sheol or from the heights above'.
    'No,' Ahaz answered 'I will not put the Lord to the test.' Then he said:
    Listen now, House of David: are you not satisfied with trying the patience
    of men without trying the patience of my God, too? The Lord himself,
    therefore, will give you a sign. It is this: the maiden is with child and
    will soon give birth to a son whom she will call Emmanuel, which means
    “God-with-us”.

    From Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus who has been called to be an apostle,
    and specially chosen to preach the Good News that God promised long ago
    through his prophets in the scriptures. This news is about the Son of God
    who, according to the human nature he took was a descendant of David: it is
    about Jesus Christ our Lord who, in the order of the spirit, the spirit of
    holiness that was in him, was proclaimed Son of God in all his power through
    his resurrection from the dead. Through him we received grace and our
    apostolic mission to preach the obedience of faith to all pagan nations in
    honour of his name. You are one of these nations, and by his call belong to
    Jesus Christ. To you all, then, who are God's beloved in Rome, called to be
    saints, may God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ send grace and peace.

    This is how Jesus Christ came to be born. His mother Mary was betrothed to
    Joseph; but before they came to live together she was found to be with child
    through the Holy Spirit. Her husband Joseph; being a man of honour and
    wanting to spare her publicity, decided to divorce her informally. He had
    made up his mind to do this when the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a
    dream and said, 'Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as
    your wife, because she has conceived what is in her by the Holy Spirit. She
    will give birth to a son and you must name him Jesus, because he is the one
    who is to save his people from their sins.' Now all this took place to
    fulfil the words spoken by the Lord through the prophet: 'The virgin will
    conceive and give birth to a son and they will call him Emmanuel, a name
    which means 'God-is-with-us'. When Joseph woke up he did what the angel of
    the Lord had told him to do: he took his wife to his home.

    Once David had settled into his house and the Lord had given him rest from
    all the enemies surrounding him, the king said to the prophet Nathan, 'Look,
    I am living in a house of cedar while the ark of God dwells in a tent'.
    Nathan said to the king, 'Go and do all that is in your mind, for the Lord
    is with you'. But that very night the word of the Lord came to Nathan: 'Go
    and tell my servant David, "Thus the Lord speaks: Are you the man to build
    me a house to dwell in? I took you from the pasture, from following the
    sheep, to be leader of my people Israel; I have been with you on all your
    expeditions; I have cut off all your enemies before you. I will give you
    fame as great as the fame of the greatest on earth. I will provide a place
    for my people Israel; I will plant them there and they shall dwell in that
    place and never be disturbed again; nor shall the wicked continue to oppress
    them as they did, in the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel;
    I will give them rest from all their enemies. The Lord will make you great;
    the Lord will make you a House. And when your days are ended and you are

    In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee
    called Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the House
    of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. He went in and said to her,
    'Rejoice, so highly favoured! The Lord is with you.' She was deeply
    disturbed by these words and asked herself what this greeting could mean,
    but the angel said to her, 'Mary, do not be afraid; you have won God's
    favour. Listen! You are to conceive and bear a son, and you must name him
    Jesus. He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High. The Lord
    God will give him the throne of his ancestor David; he will rule over the
    House of Jacob for ever and his reign will have no end.' Mary said to the
    angel, 'But how can this come about, since I am a virgin?' 'The Holy Spirit
    will come upon you' the angel answered 'and the power of the Most High will
    cover you with its shadow. And so the child will be holy and will be called
    Son of God. Know this too: your kinswoman Elizabeth has, in her old age,
    herself conceived a son, and she whom people called barren is now in her
    sixth month, for nothing is impossible to God' 'I am the handmaid of the
    Lord,' said Mary 'let what you have said be done to me.' And the angel left
    her.

    This is what Christ said, on coming into the world: You who wanted no

    the scroll of the book, 'God, here I am! I am coming to obey your will.'

    Mary set out at that time and went as quickly as she could to a town in the
    hill country of Judah. She went into Zechariah's house and greeted
    Elizabeth. Now as soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child leapt
    in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. She gave a loud

    Abraham to David; fourteen from David to the Babylonian deportation; and
    fourteen from the Babylonian deportation to Christ.

    This is how Jesus Christ came to be born. His mother Mary was betrothed to
    Joseph; but before they came to live together she was found to be with child
    through the Holy Spirit. Her husband Joseph; being a man of honour and
    wanting to spare her publicity, decided to divorce her informally. He had
    made up his mind to do this when the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a
    dream and said, 'Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as
    your wife, because she has conceived what is in her by the Holy Spirit. She
    will give birth to a son and you must name him Jesus, because he is the one
    who is to save his people from their sins.' Now all this took place to
    fulfil the words spoken by the Lord through the prophet: 'The virgin will
    conceive and give birth to a son and they will call him Emmanuel, a name
    which means 'God-is-with-us'. When Joseph woke up he did what the angel of
    the Lord had told him to do: he took his wife to his home.

    There was a man of Zorah of the tribe of Dan, called Manoah. His wife was

    woman and said to her, 'You are barren and have had no child. But from now
    on take great care. Take no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean.
    For you will conceive and bear a son. No razor is to touch his head, for the

    to rescue Israel from the power of the Philistines.' Then the woman went and
    told her husband, 'A man of God has just come to me; his presence was like
    the presence of the angel of God, he was so majestic. I did not ask him
    where he came from, and he did not reveal his name to me. But he said to me,

    In the days of King Herod of Judaea there lived a priest called Zechariah
    who belonged to the Abijah section of the priesthood, and he had a wife,
    Elizabeth by name, who was a descendant of Aaron. Both were worthy in the
    sight of God, and scrupulously observed all the commandments and observances
    of the Lord. But they were childless: Elizabeth was barren and they were
    both getting on in years. Now it was the turn of Zechariah's section to
    serve, and he was exercising his priestly office before God when it fell to
    him by lot, as the ritual custom was, to enter the Lord's sanctuary and burn
    incense there. And at the hour of incense the whole congregation was
    outside, praying. Then there appeared to him the angel of the Lord, standing
    on the right of the altar of incense. The sight disturbed Zechariah and he
    was overcome with fear. But the angel said to him, 'Zechariah, do not be
    afraid, your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth is to bear you a son
    and you must name him John. He will be your joy and delight and many will
    rejoice at his birth, for he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he must
    drink no wine, no strong drink. Even from his mother's womb he will be
    filled with the Holy Spirit, and he will bring back many of the sons of
    Israel to the Lord their God. With the spirit and power of Elijah, he will
    go before him to turn the hearts of fathers towards their children and the
    disobedient back to the wisdom that the virtuous have, preparing for the
    Lord a people fit for him. Zechariah said to the angel, 'How can I be sure
    of this? I am an old man and my wife is getting on in years.' The angel
    replied, 'I am Gabriel who stand in God's presence, and I have been sent to
    speak to you and bring you this good news. Listen! Since you have not
    believed my words, which will come true at their appointed time, you will be
    silenced and have no power of speech until this has happened.' Meanwhile the
    people were waiting for Zechariah and were surprised that he stayed in the
    sanctuary so long. When he came out he could not speak to them, and they
    realised that he had received a vision in the sanctuary. But he could only
    make signs to them, and remained dumb. When his time of service came to an
    end he returned home. Some time later his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for
    five months she kept to herself. 'The Lord has done this for me' she said
    'now that it has pleased him to take away the humiliation I suffered among
    men.'

    In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee
    called Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the House
    of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. He went in and said to her,
    'Rejoice, so highly favoured! The Lord is with you.' She was deeply
    disturbed by these words and asked herself what this greeting could mean,
    but the angel said to her, 'Mary, do not be afraid; you have won God's
    favour. Listen! You are to conceive and bear a son, and you must name him
    Jesus. He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High. The Lord
    God will give him the throne of his ancestor David; he will rule over the
    House of Jacob for ever and his reign will have no end.' Mary said to the
    angel, 'But how can this come about, since I am a virgin?' 'The Holy Spirit
    will come upon you' the angel answered 'and the power of the Most High will
    cover you with its shadow. And so the child will be holy and will be called
    Son of God. Know this too: your kinswoman Elizabeth has, in her old age,
    herself conceived a son, and she whom people called barren is now in her
    sixth month, for nothing is impossible to God' 'I am the handmaid of the
    Lord,' said Mary 'let what you have said be done to me.' And the angel left
    her.

    Mary said: 'My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord and my spirit exults
    in God my saviour; because he has looked upon his lowly handmaid. Yes, from
    this day forward all generations will call me blessed, for the Almighty has
    done great things for me. Holy is his name, and his mercy reaches from age
    to age for those who fear him. He has shown the power of his arm, he has
    routed the proud of heart. He has pulled down princes from their thrones and
    exalted the lowly. The hungry he has filled with good things, the rich sent
    empty away. He has come to the help of Israel his servant, mindful of his
    mercy -according to the promise he made to our ancestors-of his mercy to
    Abraham and to his descendants for ever.' Mary stayed with Elizabeth about
    three months and then went back home.

    The Lord God says this: Look, I am going to send my messenger to prepare a

    and the angel of the covenant whom you are longing for, yes, he is coming,
    says the Lord of hosts. Who will be able to resist the day of his coming?
    Who will remain standing when he appears? For he is like the refiner's fire
    and the fullers' alkali. He will take his seat as refiner and purifier; he
    will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and then
    they will make the offering to the Lord as it should be made. The offering
    of Judah and Jerusalem will then be welcomed by the Lord as in former days,
    as in the years of old. Know that I am going to send you Elijah the prophet

    The time came for Elizabeth to have her child, and she gave birth to a son;
    and when her neighbours and relations heard that the Lord had shown her so
    great a kindness, they shared her joy. Now on the eighth day they came to
    circumcise the child; they were going to call him Zechariah after his
    father, but his mother spoke up. 'No,' she said 'he is to be called John.'
    They said to her, 'But no one in your family has that name', and made signs
    to his father to find out what he wanted him called. The father asked for a
    writing-tablet and wrote, 'His name is John'. And they were all astonished.
    At that instant his power of speech returned and he spoke and praised God.
    All their neighbours were filled with awe and the whole affair was talked
    about throughout the hill country of Judaea. All those who heard of it
    treasured it in their hearts. 'What will this child turn out to be?' they
    wondered. And indeed the hand of the Lord was with him.

    Once David had settled into his house and the Lord had given him rest from
    all the enemies surrounding him, the king said to the prophet Nathan, 'Look,
    I am living in a house of cedar while the ark of God dwells in a tent'.
    Nathan said to the king, 'Go and do all that is in your mind, for the Lord
    is with you'. But that very night the word of the Lord came to Nathan: 'Go
    and tell my servant David, "Thus the Lord speaks: Are you the man to build
    me a house to dwell in? I took you from the pasture, from following the
    sheep, to be leader of my people Israel; I have been with you on all your
    expeditions; I have cut off all your enemies before you. I will give you
    fame as great as the fame of the greatest on earth. I will provide a place
    for my people Israel; I will plant them there and they shall dwell in that
    place and never be disturbed again; nor shall the wicked continue to oppress
    them as they did, in the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel;
    I will give them rest from all their enemies. The Lord will make you great;

    John's father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke this
    prophecy: 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel for he has visited his
    people, he has come to their rescue and he has raised up for us a power for
    salvation in the House of his servant David, even as he proclaimed, by the
    mouth of his holy prophets from ancient times, that he would save us from
    our enemies and from the hands of all who hate us. Thus he shows mercy to
    our ancestors, thus he remembers his holy covenant the oath he swore to our
    father Abraham that he would grant us, free from fear, to be delivered from
    the hands of our enemies, to serve him in holiness and virtue in his
    presence, all our days. And you, little child, you shall be called Prophet
    of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare the way for
    him. To give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of
    their sins; this by the tender mercy of our God who from on high Will bring
    the rising Sun to visit us, to give light to those who live in darkness and
    the shadow of death and to guide our feet into the way of peace.'
