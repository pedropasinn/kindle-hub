    Your interests, however, are not in the unspiritual, but in the spiritual,
    since the Spirit of God has made his home in you. In fact, unless you
    possessed the Spirit of Christ you would not belong to him, and if the
    Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, then he who
    raised Jesus from the dead will give life to your own mortal bodies through
    his Spirit living in you. So then, my brothers, there is no necessity for us
    to obey our unspiritual selves or to live unspiritual lives. If you do live
    in that way, you are doomed to die; but if by the Spirit you put an end to
    the misdeeds of the body you will live.

    Jesus went to his home town and his disciples accompanied him. With the
    coming of the sabbath he began teaching in the synagogue and most of them
    were astonished when they heard him. They said, 'Where did the man get all
    this? What is this wisdom that has been granted him, and these miracles that
    are worked through him? This is the carpenter, surely, the son of Mary, the
    brother of James and Joset and Jude and Simon? His sisters, too, are they
    not here with us?' And they would not accept him. And Jesus said to them, 'A
    prophet is only despised in his own country, among his own relations and in
    his own house'; and he could work no miracle there, though he cured a few
    sick people by laying his hands on them. He was amazed at their lack of
    faith.

    The Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them out ahead of him, in
    pairs, to all the towns and places he himself was to visit. He said to them,
    'The harvest is rich but the labourers are few, so ask the Lord of the
    harvest to send labourers to his harvest. Start off now, but remember, I am
    sending you out like lambs among wolves. Carry no purse, no haversack, no
    sandals. Salute no one on the road. Whatever house you go into, let your
    first words be, "Peace to this house!" And if a man of peace lives there,
    your peace will go and rest on him; if not, it will come back to you. Stay
    in the same house, taking what food and drink they have to offer, for the
    labourer deserves his wages; do not move from house to house. Whenever you
    go into a town where they make you welcome, eat what is set before you. Cure
    those in it who are sick, and say, "The kingdom of God is very near to you".
    But whenever you enter a town and they do not make you welcome, go out into
    its streets and say, "We wipe off the very dust of your town that clings to
    our feet, and leave it with you. Yet be sure of this: the kingdom of God is
    very near." I tell you, on that day it will not go as hard with Sodom as
    with that town. The seventy-two came back rejoicing. 'Lord,' they said 'even
    the devils submit to us when we use your name.' He said to them, 'I watched
    Satan fall like lightning from heaven. Yes, I have given you power to tread
    underfoot serpents and scorpions and the whole strength of the enemy;
    nothing shall ever hurt you. Yet do not rejoice that the spirits submit to

    Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Haran. When he had reached a certain
    place he passed the night there, since the sun had set. Taking one of the
    stones to be found at that place, he made it his pillow and lay down where
    he was. He had a dream: a ladder was there, standing on the ground with its
    top reaching to heaven; and there were angels of God going up it and coming
    down. And the Lord was there, standing over him, saying, 'I am the Lord, the
    God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac. I will give to you and
    your descendants the land on which you are lying. Your descendants shall be
    like the specks of dust on the ground; you shall spread to the west and the
    east, to the north and the south, and all the tribes of the earth shall
    bless themselves by you and your descendants. Be sure that I am with you; I
    will keep you safe wherever you go, and bring you back to this land, for I
    will not desert you before I have done all that I have promised you.' Then
    Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, 'Truly, the Lord is in this place and I
    never knew it!' He was afraid and said, 'How awe-inspiring this place is!
    This is nothing less than a house of God; this is the gate of heaven!'
    Rising early in the morning, Jacob took the stone he had used for his
    pillow, and set it up as a monument, pouring oil over the top of it. He
    named the place Bethel, but before that the town was called Luz. Jacob made
    this vow, 'If God goes with me and keeps me safe on this journey I am
    making, if he gives me bread to eat and clothes to wear, and if I return
    home safely to my father, then the Lord shall be my God. This stone I have
    set up as monument shall be a house of God.'

    Thus says the Lord: I am going to lure her and lead her out into the
    wilderness and speak to her heart. There she will respond to me as she did
    when she was young, as she did when she came out of the land of Egypt. When
    that day comes - it is the Lord who speaks - she will call me, 'My husband',
    no longer will she call me, 'My Baal' I will betroth you to myself for ever,
    betroth you with integrity and justice, with tenderness and love; I will
    betroth you to myself with faithfulness, and you will come to know the Lord.

    While Jesus was speaking, up came one of the officials, who bowed low in
    front of him and said, 'My daughter has just died, but come and lay your
    hand on her and her life will be saved'. Jesus rose and, with his disciples,
    followed him. Then from behind him came a woman, who had suffered from a
    hemorrhage for twelve years, and she touched the fringe of his cloak, for
    she said to herself, 'If I can only touch his cloak I shall be well again'.
    Jesus turned round and saw her; and he said to her, 'Courage, my daughter,
    your faith has restored you to health'. And from that moment the woman was
    well again. When Jesus reached the official's house and saw the
    flute-players, with the crowd making a commotion he said, 'Get out of here;
    the little girl is not dead, she is asleep'. And they laughed at him. But
    when the people had been turned out he went inside and took the little girl
    by the hand; and she stood up. And the news spread all round the
    countryside.

    That same night, Jacob rose, and taking his two wives and his two
    slave-girls and his eleven children he crossed the ford of the Jabbok. He
    took them and sent them across the stream and sent all his possessions over
    too. And Jacob was left alone. And there was one that wrestled with him
    until daybreak who, seeing that he could not master him, struck him in the
    socket of his hip, and Jacob's hip was dislocated as he wrestled with him.
    He said, 'Let me go, for day is breaking' But Jacob answered, 'I will not
    let you go unless you bless me'. He then asked, 'What is your name?'
    'Jacob', he replied. He said, 'Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but
    Israel, because you have been strong against God, you shall prevail against
    men'. Jacob then made this request, 'I beg you, tell me your name', but he
    replied, 'Why do you ask my name?' And he blessed him there. Jacob named the
    place Peniel, 'Because I have seen God face to face,' he said 'and I have
    survived'. The sun rose as he left Peniel, limping because of his hip. That
    is the reason why to this day the Israelites do not eat the sciatic nerve
    which is in the socket of the hip; because he had struck Jacob in the socket
    of the hip on the sciatic nerve.

    Thus says the Lord: They have set up kings, but not with my consent, and
    appointed princes, but without my knowledge. Out of their own silver and
    gold they have made idols, which are doomed to destruction. I spurn your
    calf, Samaria, my anger blazes against it. (How long will it be before they
    purge themselves of this, the sons of Israel?) A workman made the thing,
    this cannot be God! Yes, the calf of Samaria shall go up in flames. They sow

    ear will yield no flour, or, if it does, foreigners will swallow it. Ephraim
    has built altar after altar, they have only served him as occasion for sin.
    Were I to write out the thousand precepts of my Law for him, they would be

    A man was brought to Jesus, a dumb demoniac. And when the devil was cast
    out, the dumb man spoke and the people were amazed. 'Nothing like this has
    ever been seen in Israel ' they said. But the Pharisees said, 'It is through
    the prince of devils that he casts out devils'. Jesus made a tour through
    all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the
    Good News of the kingdom and curing all kinds of diseases and sickness. And
    when he saw the crowds he felt sorry for them because they were harassed and
    dejected, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, 'The
    harvest is rich but the labourers are few, so ask the Lord of the harvest to
    send labourers to his harvest'.

    When the country of Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried out to
    Pharaoh for bread. But Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, 'Go to Joseph and do
    what he tells you'.- There was famine all over the world.-Then Joseph opened
    all the granaries and sold grain to the Egyptians. The famine grew worse in
    the land of Egypt. People came to Egypt &nbsp;from all over the world to buy
    grain from Joseph, for the famine had grown severe throughout the world.
    Israel 's sons with others making the same journey went to buy grain, for
    there was famine in the land of Canaan. It was Joseph, as the man in
    authority over the country, who sold the grain to all comers. So Joseph's
    brothers went and bowed down before him, their faces touching the ground.
    When Joseph saw his brothers he recognized them. Then he kept them all in
    custody for three days. On the third day Joseph said to them, 'Do this and
    you shall keep your lives, for I am a man who fears God. If you are honest
    men let one of your brothers be kept in the place of your detention; as for
    you, go and take grain to relieve the famine of your families. You shall
    bring me your youngest brother; this way your words will be proved true, and
    you will not have to die!' This they did. They said to one another, 'Truly
    we are being called to account for our brother. We saw his misery of soul
    when he begged our mercy, but we did not listen to him and now this misery
    has come home to us.' Reuben answered them, 'Did I not tell you not to wrong
    the boy? But you did not listen, and now we are brought to account for his
    blood.' They did not know that Joseph understood, because there was an
    interpreter between them. He left them and wept.

    Israel was a luxuriant vine yielding plenty of fruit. The more his fruit

    he made the sacred stones. Their heart is a divided heart; very well, they
    must pay for it: the Lord is going to break their altars down and destroy

    not feared the Lord'. But what can a king do for us? Samaria has had her
    day. Her king is like a straw drifting on the water. The idolatrous high

    spirits with power to cast them out and to cure all kinds of diseases and
    sickness. These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon who is
    called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and his
    brother John; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector;
    James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot and Judas
    Iscariot, the one who was to betray him. These twelve Jesus sent out,
    instructing them as follows: 'Do not turn your steps to pagan territory, and

    Israel. And as you go, proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand.

    presence again". When we went back to your servant my father, we repeated to
    him what my lord had said. So when our father said, "Go back and buy us a
    little food", we said, "We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with
    us, we will go down, for we cannot be admitted to the man's presence unless
    our youngest brother is with us." So your servant our father said to us,
    "You know that my wife bore me two children. When one left me, I said that
    he must have been torn to pieces. And I have not seen him to this day. If
    you take this one from me too and any harm comes to him, you will send me
    down to Sheol with my white head bowed in misery." Then Joseph could not
    control his feelings in front of all his retainers, and he exclaimed, 'Let
    everyone leave me'. No one therefore was present with him while Joseph made
    himself known to his brothers, but he wept so loudly that all the Egyptians
    heard, and the news reached Pharaoh's palace. Joseph said to his brothers,
    'I am Joseph. Is my father really still alive?' His brothers could not
    answer him, they were so dismayed at the sight of him. Then Joseph said to
    his brothers, 'Come closer to me'. When they had come closer to him he said,
    'I am your brother Joseph whom you sold into Egypt. But now, do not grieve,
    do not reproach yourselves for having sold me here, since God sent me before
    you to preserve your lives.

    they have offered sacrifice to the Baals and set their offerings smoking
    before the idols. I myself taught Ephraim to walk, I took them in my arms;

    Israel left with his possessions, and reached Beersheba. There he
    offered&nbsp; sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. God spoke to Israel
    &nbsp;in a vision at night, 'Jacob, Jacob', he said. 'I am here', he
    replied. 'I am God, the God of&nbsp; your father', he continued. 'Do not be
    afraid of going down to Egypt, for I will make you a great nation there. I
    myself will go down to Egypt&nbsp; with you. I myself will bring you back
    again, and Joseph's hand shall close your eyes.' Then Jacob left Beersheba.
    Israel 's sons conveyed their father Jacob, their little children and their
    wives in the wagons Pharaoh had sent to fetch him. Taking their livestock
    and all that they had acquired in the land of Canaan, they went to Egypt,
    Jacob and all his family with him: his sons and his grand-sons, his
    daughters and his grand-daughters, in a word, all his children he took with
    him to Egypt. Israel sent Judah ahead to Joseph, so that the latter might
    present himself to him in Goshen. When they arrived in the land of Goshen,
    Joseph had his chariot made ready and went up to meet his father Israel in
    Goshen. As soon as he appeared he threw his arms round his neck and for a
    long time wept on his shoulder. Israel said to Joseph, 'Now I can die, now
    that I have seen you again, and seen you still alive.'

    Jacob gave his sons these instructions, 'I am about to be gathered to my
    people. Bury me near my fathers, in the cave that is in the field of Ephron
    the Hittite, in the cave in the field at Machpelah, opposite Mamre, in the
    land of Canaan, which Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite as a
    burial-plot. There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah. There Isaac was
    buried and his wife Rebekah. There I buried Leah. I mean the field and the
    cave in it that were bought from the sons of Heth.'49:33 When Jacob had
    finished giving his instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the
    bed, and breathing his last was gathered to his people. Seeing that their
    father was dead, Joseph's brothers said, 'What if Joseph intends to treat us
    as enemies and repay us in full for all the wrong we did him?' So they sent
    this message to Joseph: 'Before your father died he gave us this order: "You
    must say to Joseph: Oh forgive your brothers their crime and their sin and
    all the wrong they did you". Now therefore, we beg you, forgive the crime of
    the servants of your father's God.' Joseph wept at the message they sent to
    him. His brothers came themselves and fell down before him. 'We present
    ourselves before you' they said 'as your slaves.' But Joseph answered them,
    'Do not be afraid; is it for me to put myself in God's place? The evil you
    planned to do me has by God's design been turned to good, that he might
    bring about, as indeed he has, the deliverance of a numerous people. So you
    need not be afraid; I myself will provide for you and your dependants.' In
    this way he reassured them with words that touched their hearts. So Joseph
    stayed in Egypt with his father's family; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten
    years. Joseph saw the third generation of Ephraim's children, as also the
    children of Machir, Manasseh's son, who were born on Joseph's lap. At length
    Joseph said to his brothers, 'I am about to die; but God will be sure to
    remember you kindly and take you back from this country to the land that he
    promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob'. And Joseph made Israel 's
    sons swear an oath, 'When God remembers you with kindness be sure to take my
    bones from here'. Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten; they embalmed
    him and laid him in his coffin in Egypt.

    In the year of King Uzziah's death I saw the Lord seated on a high throne;
    his train filled the sanctuary; above him stood seraphs, each one with six
    wings: two to cover its face, two to cover its feet and two for flying. And
    they cried out one to another in this way, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of
    hosts. His glory fills the whole earth.' The foundations of the threshold
    shook with the voice of the one who cried out and the Temple was filled with
    smoke. I said: 'What a wretched state I am in! I am lost, for I am a man of
    unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have
    looked at the King, the Lord of hosts.' Then one of the seraphs flew to me,
    holding in his hand a live coal which he had taken from the altar with a
    pair of tongs. With this he touched my mouth and said: 'See now, this has
    touched your lips, your sin is taken away, your iniquity is purged'. Then I
    heard the voice of the Lord saying: 'Whom shall I send? Who will be our

    Jesus said to his apostles: 'The disciple is not superior to his teacher,
    nor the slave to his master. It is enough for the disciple that he should
    grow to be like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have
    called the master of the house Beelzebul, what will they not say of his
    household? 'Do not be afraid of them therefore. For everything that is now
    covered will be uncovered, and everything now hidden will be made clear.
    What I say to you in the dark, tell in the daylight; what you hear in
    whispers, proclaim from the housetops. 'Do not be afraid of those who kill
    the body but cannot kill the soul; fear him rather who can destroy both body
    and soul in hell. Can you not buy two sparrows for a penny? And yet not one
    falls to the ground without your Father knowing. Why, every hair on your
    head has been counted. So there is no need to be afraid; you are worth more
    than hundreds of sparrows. 'So if anyone declares himself for me in the
    presence of men, I will declare myself for him in the presence of my Father
    in heaven. But the one who disowns me in the presence of men, I will disown
    in the presence of my Father in heaven.
