    When Jesus received the news of John the Baptist's death he withdrew by boat
    to a lonely place where they could be by themselves. But the people heard of
    this and, leaving the towns, went after him on foot. So as he stepped ashore
    he saw a large crowd; and he took pity on them and healed their sick. When
    evening came, the disciples went to him and said, 'This is a lonely place,
    and the time has slipped by; so send the people away, and they can go to the
    villages to buy themselves some food'. Jesus replied, 'There is no need for
    them to go: give them something to eat yourselves'. But they answered 'All
    we have with us is five loaves and two fish'. 'Bring them here to me' he
    said. He gave orders that the people were to sit down on the grass; then he
    took the five loaves and the two fish, raised his eyes to heaven and said
    the blessing. And breaking the loaves handed them to his disciples who gave
    them to the crowds. They all ate as much as they wanted, and they collected
    the scraps remaining; twelve baskets full. Those who ate numbered about five
    thousand men, to say nothing of women and children.

    The whole community of the sons of Israel began to complain against Moses
    and Aaron in the wilderness and said to them, 'Why did we not die at the
    Lord's hand in the land of Egypt, when we were able to sit down to pans of
    meat and could eat bread to our heart's content! As it is, you have brought
    us to this wilderness to starve this whole company to death!' Then the Lord
    said to Moses, 'Now I will rain down bread for you from the heavens. Each
    day the people are to go out and gather the day's portion; I propose to test
    them in this way to see whether they will follow my law or not. 'I have
    heard the complaints of the sons of Israel. Say this to them, "Between the
    two evenings you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall have bread to
    your heart's content. Then you will learn that I, the Lord, am your God."'
    And so it came about: quails flew up in the evening, and they covered the
    camp; in the morning there was a coating of dew all round the camp. When the
    coating of dew lifted, there on the surface of the desert was a thing
    delicate, powdery, as fine as hoarfrost on the ground. When they saw this,
    the sons of Israel said to one another, 'What is that?' not knowing what it
    was. 'That' said Moses to them 'is the bread the Lord gives you to eat.

    I want to urge you in the name of the Lord, not to go on living the aimless
    kind of life that pagans live. Now that is hardly the way you have learnt
    from Christ, unless you failed to hear him properly when you were taught
    what the truth is in Jesus. You must give up your old way of life; you must
    put aside your old self, which gets corrupted by following illusory desires.
    Your mind must be renewed by a spiritual revolution so that you can put on

    When the people saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they
    got into those boats and crossed to Capernaum to look for Jesus. When they
    found him on the other side, they said to him, 'Rabbi, when did you come
    here?' Jesus answered: 'I tell you most solemnly, you are not looking for me
    because you have seen the signs but because you had all the bread you wanted
    to eat. Do not work for food that cannot last, but work for food that
    endures to eternal life, the kind of food the Son of Man is offering you,
    for on him the Father, God himself, has set his seal.' Then they said to
    him, 'What must we do if we are to do the works that God wants?' Jesus gave
    them this answer, 'This is working for God: you must believe in the one he
    has sent'. So they said, 'What Sign will you give to show us that we should
    believe in you? What work will you do? Our fathers had manna to eat in the
    desert; as scripture says: He gave them bread from heaven to eat'. Jesus
    answered: 'I tell you most solemnly, it was not Moses who gave you bread
    from heaven, it is my Father who gives you the bread from heaven, the true
    bread; for the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives
    life to the world'. 'Sir,' they said 'give us that bread always.' Jesus
    answered: 'I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never be hungry;
    he who believes in me will never thirst.

    Since you have been brought back to true life with Christ, you must look for
    the things that are in heaven, where Christ is, sitting at God's right hand.
    Let your thoughts be on heavenly things, not on the things that are on the
    earth, because you have died, and now the life you have is hidden with
    Christ in God. But when Christ is revealed - and he is your life - you too
    will be revealed in all your glory with him. That is why you must kill
    everything in you that belongs only to earthly life: fornication, impurity,
    guilty passion, evil desires and especially greed, which is the same thing
    as worshipping a false god; and never tell each other lies. You have
    stripped off your old behaviour with your old self, and you have put on a

    A man in the crowd said to Jesus, 'Master, tell my brother to give me a
    share of our inheritance'. 'My friend,' he replied-'who appointed me your
    judge, or the arbitrator of your claims?' Then he said to them, 'Watch, and
    be on your guard against avarice of any kind, for a man's life is not made
    secure by what he owns, even when he has more than he needs'. Then he told
    them a parable: 'There was once a rich man who, having had a good harvest
    from his land, thought to himself, "What am I to do? I have not enough room
    to store my crops." Then he said, "This is what I will will pull down my
    barns and build bigger ones, and store all my grain and my goods in them,
    and I will say to my soul: My soul, you have plenty of good things laid by
    for many years to come; take things easy, eat, drink, have a good time". But
    God said to him, "Fool! This very night the demand will be made for your
    soul; and this hoard of yours, whose will it be then?". So it is when a man
    stores up treasure for himself in place of making himself rich in the sight
    of God.'

    The sons of Israel began to wail, 'Who will give us meat to eat?' they said.
    'Think of the fish we used to eat free in Egypt, the cucumbers, melons,
    leeks, onions and garlic! Here we are wasting away, stripped of everything;
    there is nothing but manna for us to look at!' The manna was like coriander
    seed, and had the appearance of bdellium. The people went round gathering
    it, and ground it in a mill or crushed it with a pestle; it was then cooked
    in a pot and made into pancakes. It tasted like cake made with oil. When the
    dew fell on the camp at night-time, the manna fell with it. Moses heard the
    people wailing, every family at the door of its tent. The anger of the Lord
    flared out, and Moses greatly worried over this. And he spoke to the Lord:
    'Why do you treat your servant so badly? Why have I not found favour with
    you, so that you load on me the weight of all this nation? Was it I who
    conceived all this people, was it I who gave them birth, that you should say
    to me, "Carry them in your bosom, like a nurse with a baby at the breast, to
    the land that I swore to give their fathers"? Where am I to find meat to
    give to all this people, when they come worrying me so tearfully and say,
    "Give us meat to eat"? I am not able to carry this nation by myself alone;
    the weight is too much for me. If this is how you want to deal with me, I

    That same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah in

    says this, "I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. In two years'
    time I will bring back all the vessels of the Temple of the Lord which
    Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon carried off from this place and took to
    Babylon. And I will also bring back Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of
    Judah, and all the exiles of Judah who have gone to Babylon - it is the Lord
    who speaks. Yes, I am going to break the yoke of the king of Babylon."' The

    priests and all the people there in the Temple of the Lord. 'I hope so' the
    prophet Jeremiah said. 'May the Lord do so. May he fulfill the words that
    you have prophesied and bring the vessels of the Temple of the Lord and all
    the exiles back to this place from Babylon. Listen carefully, however, to
    this word that I am now going to say for you and all the people to hear:
    From remote times, the prophets who preceded you and me prophesied war,
    famine and plague for many countries and for great kingdoms; but the prophet
    who prophesies peace can only be recognized as one truly sent by the Lord
    when his word comes true.' The prophet Hananiah then took the yoke off the
    neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it. In front of all the people
    Hananiah then said, 'The Lord says this, "This is how, two years hence, I
    will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and take it off the
    necks of all the nations"'. At this, the prophet Jeremiah went away. After
    the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke which he had taken off the neck of
    the prophet Jeremiah the word of the Lord was addressed to Jeremiah, 'Go to
    Hananiah and tell him this, "The Lord says this: You can break wooden yokes?
    Right, I will make them iron yokes instead! For the Lord of hosts, the God
    of Israel, says this: An iron yoke is what I now lay on the necks of all
    these nations to subject them to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. (They will
    be subject to him; I have even given him the wild animals.)"' The prophet
    Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, 'Listen carefully, Hananiah: the Lord
    has not sent you; and thanks to you this people are now relying on what is
    false. Hence – the Lord says this, "I am going to throw you off the face of
    the earth: you are going to die this year (since you have preached apostasy
    from the Lord)".' The prophet Hananiah died the same year, in the seventh
    month.

    After having fed the crowds, Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and
    go on ahead to the other side while he would send the crowds away. After
    sending the crowds away he went up into the hills by himself to pray. When
    evening came, he was there alone, while the boat, by now far out on the
    lake, was battling with a heavy sea, for there was a head-wind. In the
    fourth watch of the night he went towards them, walking on the lake, and
    when the disciples saw him walking on the lake they were terrified. 'It is a
    ghost' they said, and cried out in fear. But at once Jesus called out to
    them, saying, 'Courage! It is I! Do not be afraid.' lt was Peter who
    answered. 'Lord,' he said 'if it is you, tell me to come to you across the
    water.' 'Come' said Jesus. Then Peter got out of the boat and started
    walking towards Jesus across the water, but as soon as he felt the force of
    the wind, he took fright and began to sink. 'Lord! Save me!' he cried. Jesus
    put out his hand at once and held him. 'Man of little faith,' he said 'why
    did you doubt?' And as they got into the boat the wind dropped. The men in
    the boat bowed down before him and said, 'Truly, you are the Son of God'.
    Having made the crossing, they came to land at Gennesaret. When the local
    people recognised him they spread the news through the whole neighbourhood
    and took all that were sick to him, begging him just to let them touch the
    fringe of his cloak. And all those who touched it were completely cured.

    When Jesus received the news of John the Baptist's death he withdrew by boat
    to a lonely place where they could be by themselves. But the people heard of
    this and, leaving the towns, went after him on foot. So as he stepped ashore
    he saw a large crowd; and he took pity on them and healed their sick. When
    evening came, the disciples went to him and said, 'This is a lonely place,
    and the time has slipped by; so send the people away, and they can go to the
    villages to buy themselves some food'. Jesus replied, 'There is no need for
    them to go: give them something to eat yourselves'. But they answered 'All
    we have with us is five loaves and two fish'. 'Bring them here to me' he
    said. He gave orders that the people were to sit down on the grass; then he
    took the five loaves and the two fish, raised his eyes to heaven and said
    the blessing. And breaking the loaves handed them to his disciples who gave
    them to the crowds. They all ate as much as they wanted, and they collected
    the scraps remaining; twelve baskets full. Those who ate numbered about five
    thousand men, to say nothing of women and children.

    Miriam, and Aaron too, spoke against Moses in connection with the Cushite
    woman he had taken. (For he had married a Cushite woman.) They said, 'Has
    the Lord spoken to Moses only? Has he not spoken to us too?' The Lord heard
    this. 'Now Moses was the most humble of men, the humblest man on earth.
    Suddenly, the Lord said to Moses and Aaron and Miriam, 'Come, all three of
    you, to the Tent of Meeting'. They went, all three of them, and the Lord
    came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the Tent. He
    called Aaron and Miriam and they both came forward. The Lord said, 'Listen
    now to my words: If any man among you is a prophet I make myself known to
    him in a vision, I speak to him in a dream. Not so with my servant Moses: he
    is at home in my house; I speak with him face to face, plainly and not in
    riddles, and he sees the form of the Lord. How then have you dared to speak
    against my servant Moses?' The anger of the Lord blazed out against them. He
    departed, and as soon as the cloud withdrew from the Tent, there was Miriam
    a leper, white as snow! Aaron turned to look at her; she had become a leper.
    Aaron said to Moses: 'Help me, my lord! Do not punish us for a sin committed
    in folly of which we are guilty. I entreat you, do not let her be like a
    monster, coming from its mother's womb with flesh half corrupted.' Moses
    cried to the Lord, 'O God,' he said 'please heal her, I beg you!'

    The word addressed to Jeremiah by the Lord: The Lord, the God of Israel says

    this: Your wound is incurable, your injury past healing. There is no one to
    care for your sore, no medicine to make you well again. All your lovers have
    forgotten you, they look for you no more. Yes, I have struck you as an enemy
    strikes, with harsh punishment (so great is your guilt, so many your sins).
    Why bother to complain about your wound? Your pain is incurable. So great is
    your guilt, so many your sins, that I have done all this to you. The Lord
    says this: Now I will restore the tents of Jacob, and take pity on his
    dwellings: the city shall be rebuilt on its ruins, the citadel restored on
    its site. From them will come thanksgiving and shouts of joy. I will make
    them increase, and not diminish them, make them honoured, and not disdained.
    Their sons shall be as once they were, their community fixed firm in my
    presence, and I will punish all their oppressors. Their prince will be one
    of their own, their ruler come from their own people. I will let him come
    freely into my presence and he can come close to me; who else, indeed, would
    risk his life by coming close to me? - it is the Lord who speaks. And you
    shall be my people and I will be your God.

    The Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Paran and said, 'Send out men,
    one from each tribe, to make a reconnaissance of this land of Canaan which I
    am giving to the sons of Israel. Send the leader of each tribe.' At the end
    of forty days, they came back from their reconnaissance of the land. They
    sought out Moses, Aaron and the whole community of Israel, in the wilderness
    of Paran, at Kadesh. They made their report to them, and to the whole
    community, and showed them the produce of the country. They told them this
    story, 'We went into the land to which you sent us. It does indeed flow with
    milk and honey; this is its produce. At the same time, its inhabitants are a
    powerful people; the towns are fortified and very big; yes, and we saw the
    descendants of Anak there. The Amalekite holds the Negeb area, the Hittite,
    Amorite and Jebusite the highlands, and the Canaanite the sea coast and the
    banks of the Jordan.' Caleb harangued the people gathered about Moses: 'We
    must march in,' he said 'and conquer this land: we are well able to do it'.
    But the men who had gone up with him answered, 'We are not able to march
    against this people; they are stronger than we are'. And they began to
    disparage the country they had reconnoitered to the sons of Israel, 'The
    country we went to reconnoiter is a country that devours its inhabitants.
    Every man we saw there was of enormous size. Yes, and we saw giants there
    (the sons of Anak, descendants of the Giants).We felt like grasshoppers, and
    so we seemed to them.' At this, the whole community raised their voices and
    cried aloud, and the people wailed all that night. The Lord spoke to Moses
    and Aaron. He said: 'How long does this perverse community, which complains
    against me...? I have heard the complaints which the sons of Israel make
    against me. Say to them, "As I live - it is the Lord who speaks - I will
    deal with you according to the very words you have used in my hearing. In
    this wilderness your dead bodies will fall, all you men of the census, all
    you who were numbered from the age of twenty years and over, you who have
    complained against me. For forty days you reconnoitered the land. Each day
    shall count for a year: for forty years you shall bear the burden of your
    sins, and you shall learn what it means to reject me." I, the Lord, have
    spoken: this is how I will deal with this perverse community that has
    conspired against me. Here in this wilderness, to the last man, they shall
    die.'

    When that time comes - it is the Lord who speaks - I will be the God of all
    the clans of Israel: they shall be my people. The Lord says this: They have
    found pardon in the wilderness, those who have survived the sword. Israel is
    marching to his rest. The Lord has appeared to him from afar: I have loved
    you with an everlasting love, so I am constant in my affection for you. I
    build you once more; you shall be rebuilt, virgin of Israel. Adorned once
    more, and with your tambourines, you will go out dancing gaily. You will

    Jesus left Gennesaret and withdrew to the region of Tyre and
    Sidon.&nbsp;Then out came a Canaanite woman from that district and started
    shouting, 'Sir, Son of David, take pity on me. My daughter is tormented by a
    devil.'&nbsp;But he answered her not a word. And his disciples went and
    pleaded with him. 'Give her what she wants,' they said 'because she is
    shouting after us.'&nbsp;He said in reply, 'I was sent only to the lost
    sheep of the House of Israel'.&nbsp;But the woman had come up and was
    kneeling at his feet. 'Lord,' she said 'help me.'&nbsp;He replied, 'It is
    not fair to take the children's food and throw it to the
    house-dogs'.&nbsp;She retorted, 'Ah yes, sir; but even house-dogs can eat
    the scraps that fall from their master's table'.&nbsp;Then Jesus answered
    her, 'Woman, you have great faith. Let your wish be granted.' And from that
    moment her daughter was well again.

  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    The sons of Israel, the whole community, arrived in the first month at the
    desert of Zin. The people settled at Kadesh. It was there that Miriam died
    and was buried. There was no water for the community, and they were all
    united against Moses and Aaron. The people challenged Moses: 'We would
    rather have died,' they said 'as our brothers died before the Lord! Why did
    you bring the assembly of the Lord into this wilderness, only to let us die
    here, ourselves and our cattle? Why did you lead us out of Egypt, only to
    bring us to this wretched place? It is a place unfit for sowing, it has no
    figs, no vines, no pomegranates, and there is not even water to drink!'
    Leaving the assembly, Moses and Aaron went to the door of the Tent of
    Meeting. They threw themselves face downward on the ground, and the glory of
    the Lord appeared to them. The Lord spoke to Moses and said, 'Take the
    branch and call the community together, you and your brother Aaron. Then, in
    full view of them, order this rock to give water. You will make water flow
    for them out of the rock, and provide drink for the community and their
    cattle.' Moses took up the branch from before the Lord, as he had directed
    him. Then Moses and Aaron called the assembly together in front of the rock
    and addressed them, 'Listen now, you rebels. Shall we make water gush from
    this rock for you?' And Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with
    the branch; water gushed in abundance, and the community drank and their
    cattle too. Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, 'Because you did not
    believe that I could proclaim my holiness in the eyes of the sons of Israel,
    you shall not lead this assembly into the land I am giving them'. These are
    the waters of Meribah, where the sons of Israel challenged the Lord and he
    proclaimed his holiness.

    When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi he put this question to
    his disciples, 'Who do people say the Son of Man is?' And they said, 'Some
    say he is John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the
    prophets'. 'But you,' he said 'who do you say I am?' Then Simon Peter spoke
    up, 'You are the Christ,' he said 'the Son of the living God'. Jesus
    replied, 'Simon son of Jonah, you are a happy man! Because it was not flesh
    and blood that revealed this to you but my Father in heaven. So I now say to
    you: You are Peter and on this rock I will build my Church. And the gates of
    the underworld can never hold out against it. I will give you the keys of
    the kingdom of heaven: whatever you bind on earth shall be considered bound
    in heaven; whatever you loose on earth shall be considered loosed in
    heaven.' Then he gave the disciples strict orders not to tell anyone that he
    was the Christ. From that time Jesus began to make it clear to his disciples
    that he was destined to go to Jerusalem and suffer grievously at the hands
    of the elders and chief priests and scribes, to be put to death and to be
    raised up on the third day. Then, taking him aside, Peter started to
    remonstrate with him. 'Heaven preserve you, Lord;' he said 'this must not
    happen to you'. But he turned and said to Peter, 'Get behind me, Satan! You
    are an obstacle in my path, because the way you think is not God's way but
    man's.'

    Moses said to the people: 'Put this question to the ages that are past, that
    went before you, from the time God created man on earth: Was there ever a
    word so majestic, from one end of heaven to the other? Was anything ever
    heard? Did ever a people hear the voice of the living God speaking from the
    heart of the fire, as you heard it, and remain alive? Has any god ventured
    to take to himself one nation from the midst of another by ordeals, signs,
    wonders, war with mighty hand and outstretched arm, by fearsome terrors -
    all this that the Lord your God did for you before your eyes in Egypt? This
    he showed you so that you might know that the Lord is God indeed and that
    there is no other. He let you hear his voice out of heaven for your
    instruction; on earth he let you see his great fire, and from the heart of
    the fire you heard his word. Because he loved your fathers and chose their
    descendants after them, he brought you out from Egypt, openly showing his
    presence and his great power,4:38 driving out in front of you nations
    greater and more powerful than yourself, and brought you into their land to
    give it you for your heritage, as it is still today. Understand this today,
    therefore, and take it to heart: the Lord is God indeed, in heaven above as
    on earth beneath, he and no other. Keep his laws and commandments as I give
    them to you today, so that you and your children may prosper and live long

    wants to save his life will lose it; but anyone who loses his life for my
    sake will find it. What, then, will a man gain if he wins the whole world
    and ruins his life? Or what has a man to offer in exchange for his life?
    'For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of his Father with his
    angels, and, when he does, he will reward each one according to his
    behaviour. I tell you solemnly, there are some of these standing here who
    will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming with his
    kingdom.'

    Moses said to the people: ' Listen, Israel: the Lord our God is the one
    Lord. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your
    soul, with all your strength. Let these words I urge on you today be written
    on your heart. You shall repeat them to your children and say them over to
    them whether at rest in your house or walking abroad, at your lying down or
    at your rising; you shall fasten them on your hand as a sign and on your
    forehead as a circlet; you shall write them on the doorposts of your house
    and on your gates. 'When the Lord has brought you into the land which he
    swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that he would give you, with
    great and prosperous cities not of your building, houses full of good things
    not furnished by you, wells you did not dig, vineyards and olives you did
    not plant, when you have eaten these and had your fill, then take care you
    do not forget the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the
    house of slavery. You must fear the Lord your God, you must serve him, by
    his name you must swear.

    A reading from the&nbsp;Book of the Prophet Habakkuk<span class="alindcha">1:12-2:4</span>
  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    Are not you, from ancient times Lord, my God, my Holy One, who never dies?
    Lord, you have made this people an instrument of justice, set it firm as a
    rock in order to punish. Your eyes are too pure to rest on wickedness, you
    cannot look on at tyranny. Why do you look on while men are treacherous, and
    stay silent while the evil man swallows a better man than he? You treat
    mankind like fishes in the sea, like creeping, masterless things. A people,
    these, who catch all on their hook, who draw them with their net, in their
    dragnet gather them, and so, triumphantly, rejoice. At this, they offer a
    sacrifice to their net, and burn incense to their dragnet, for providing
    them with luxury and lavish food. Are they then to empty their net
    unceasingly, slaughtering nations without pity? I will stand on my
    watchtower, and take up my post on my battlements, watching to see what he
    will say to me, what answer he will make to my complaints. Then the Lord
    answered and said, 'Write the vision down, inscribe it on tablets to be
    easily read, since this vision is for its own time only: eager for its own
    fulfilment, it does not deceive; if it comes slowly, wait, for come it will,
    without fail. 'See how he flags, he whose soul is not at rights, but the
    upright man will live by his faithfulness.'

    A man came up to Jesus and went down on his knees before him. 'Lord,' he
    said 'take pity on my son: he is a lunatic and in a wretched state; he is
    always falling into the fire or into the water. I took him to your disciples
    and they were unable to cure him.' 'Faithless and perverse generation!'
    Jesus said in reply 'How much longer must I be with you? How much longer
    must I put up with you? Bring him here to me.' And when Jesus rebuked it the
    devil came out of the boy who was cured from that moment. Then the disciples
    came privately to Jesus. 'Why were we unable to cast it out? they asked. He
    answered, 'Because you have little faith. I tell you solemnly, if your faith
    were the size of a mustard seed you could say to this mountain, "Move from
    here to there", and it would move; nothing would be impossible for you.'
