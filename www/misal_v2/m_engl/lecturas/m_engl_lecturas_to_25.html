    Christ will be glorified in my body, whether by my life or by my death.

    Jesus told this parable to his disciples: 'The kingdom of heaven is like a
    landowner going out at daybreak to hire workers for his vineyard. &nbsp;He
    made an agreement with the workers for one denarius a day, and sent them to
    his vineyard. &nbsp;Going out at about the third hour he saw others standing
    idle in the market place &nbsp;and said to them, "You go to my vineyard too
    and I will give you a fair wage". &nbsp;So they went. At about the sixth
    hour and again at about the ninth hour, he went out and did the same.
    &nbsp;Then at about the eleventh hour he went out and found more men
    standing round, and he said to them, "Why have you been standing here idle
    all day?" &nbsp;"Because no one has hired us" they answered. He said to
    them, "You go into my vineyard too". &nbsp;In the evening, the owner of the
    vineyard said to his bailiff, "Call the workers and pay them their wages,
    starting with the last arrivals and ending with the first". &nbsp;So those
    who were hired at about the eleventh hour came forward and received one
    denarius each. &nbsp;When the first came, they expected to get more, but
    they too received one denarius each. &nbsp;They took it, but grumbled at the
    landowner. &nbsp;"The men who came last" they said "have done only one hour,
    and you have treated them the same as us, though we have done a heavy day's
    work in all the heat." &nbsp;He answered one of them and said, "My friend, I
    am not being unjust to you; did we not agree on one denarius? &nbsp;Take
    your earnings and go. I choose to pay the last comer as much as I pay you.
    &nbsp;Have I no right to do what I like with my own? Why be envious because
    I am generous?" &nbsp;Thus the last will be first, and the first, last.'

    Wherever you find jealousy and ambition, you find disharmony, and wicked
    things of every kind being done; &nbsp;whereas the wisdom that comes down
    from above is essentially something pure; it also makes for peace, and is
    kindly and considerate; it is full of compassion and shows itself by doing
    good; nor is there any trace of partiality or hypocrisy in it.
    &nbsp;Peacemakers, when they work for peace, sow the seeds which will bear
    fruit in holiness. &nbsp;Where do these wars and battles between yourselves
    first start? Isn't it precisely in the desires fighting inside your own
    selves? &nbsp;You want something and you haven't got it; so you are prepared
    to kill. You have an ambition that you cannot satisfy; so you fight to get
    your way by force. Why you don't have what you want is because you don't
    pray for it; &nbsp;when you do pray and don't get it, it is because you have
    not prayed properly, you have prayed for something to indulge your own
    desires.

    After leaving the mountain Jesus and his disciples made their way through
    Galilee; and he did not want anyone to know, &nbsp;because he was
    instructing his disciples; he was telling them, 'The Son of Man will be
    delivered into the hands of men; they will put him to death; and three days
    after he has been put to death he will rise again'. &nbsp;But they did not
    understand what he said and were afraid to ask him. &nbsp;They came to
    Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them, 'What were you
    arguing about on the road?' &nbsp;They said nothing because they had been
    arguing which of them was the greatest. &nbsp;So he sat down, called the
    Twelve to him and said, 'If anyone wants to be first, he must make himself
    last of all and servant of all'. &nbsp;He then took a little child, set him
    in front of them, put his arms round him, and said to them, &nbsp;'Anyone
    who welcomes one of these little children in my name, welcomes me; and
    anyone who welcomes me welcomes not me but the one who sent me'.

    Jesus said to his disciples, 'There was a rich man and he had a steward
    denounced to him for being wasteful with his property.&nbsp;He called for
    the man and said, "What is this I hear about you? Draw me up an account of
    your stewardship because you are not to be my steward any longer."
    &nbsp;Then the steward said to himself, "Now that my master is taking the
    stewardship from me, what am I to do? Dig? I am not strong enough. Go
    begging? I should be too ashamed. &nbsp;Ah, I know what I will do to make
    sure that when I am dismissed from office there will be some to welcome me
    into their homes." &nbsp;Then he called his master's debtors one by one. To
    the first he said, "How much do you owe my master?" &nbsp;"One hundred
    measures of oil" was the reply. The steward said, "Here, take your bond; sit
    down straight away and write fifty". &nbsp;To another he said, "And you,
    sir, how much do you owe?" "One hundred measures of wheat" was the reply.
    The steward said, "Here, take your bond and write eighty". &nbsp;'The master
    praised the dishonest steward for his astuteness. For the children of this
    world are more astute in dealing with their own kind than are the children
    of light.'&nbsp;'And so I tell you this: use money, tainted as it is, to win
    you friends, and thus make sure that when it fails you, they will welcome
    you into the tents of eternity. &nbsp;The man who can be trusted in little
    things can be trusted in great; the man who is dishonest in little things
    will be dishonest in great. &nbsp;If then you cannot be trusted with money,
    that tainted thing, who will trust you with genuine riches? &nbsp;And if you
    cannot be trusted with what is not yours, who will give you what is your
    very own? &nbsp;'No servant can be the slave of two masters: he will either
    hate the first and love the second, or treat the first with respect and the
    second with scorn. You cannot be the slave both of God and of money.'

    In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, to fulfill the word of&nbsp;the
    Lord that was spoken through Jeremiah,&nbsp; the Lord roused the spirit of
    Cyrus king of Persia to issue a proclamation and to have it publicly
    displayed throughout his kingdom: &nbsp;'Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia,
    "Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has
    ordered me to build him a Temple in Jerusalem, in Judah. &nbsp;Whoever there
    is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up to
    Jerusalem in Judah to build the Temple of the Lord, the God of Israel - he
    is the God who is in Jerusalem. &nbsp;And let each survivor, wherever he
    lives, be helped by the people of that place with silver and gold, with
    goods and cattle, as well as voluntary offerings for the Temple of God which
    is in Jerusalem." ' &nbsp;Then the heads of families of Judah and of
    Benjamin, the priests and the Levites, in fact all whose spirit had been
    roused by God, prepared to go and rebuild the Temple of the Lord in
    Jerusalem; &nbsp;and all their neighbours gave them every assistance with

    My son, do not refuse a kindness to anyone who begs it, if it is in your
    power to perform it. &nbsp;Do not say to your neighbour, 'Go away! Come
    another time! I will give it you tomorrow', if you can do it now. &nbsp;Do
    not plot harm against your neighbour as he lives unsuspecting next door.
    &nbsp;Do not pick a groundless quarrel with a man who has done you no harm.
    &nbsp;Do not emulate the man of violence, never model your conduct on his;
    &nbsp;for the wilful wrong-doer is abhorrent to the Lord, who confides only
    in honest men. &nbsp;The Lord's curse lies on the house of the wicked, but
    he blesses the home of the virtuous. &nbsp;He mocks those who mock, but
    accords his favour to the humble.

    King Darius wrote to the satrap of Transeuphrates and his colleagues: leave
    the high commissioner of Judah and the elders of the Jews to work on this
    Temple of God; they are to rebuild this Temple of God on its ancient site.
    &nbsp;This, I decree, is how you must assist the elders of the Jews in the
    reconstruction of this Temple of God: the expenses of these people are to be
    paid, promptly and without fail, from the royal revenue-that is, from the
    tribute of Transeuphrates. &nbsp;I, Darius, have issued this decree. Let it
    be obeyed to the letter!' &nbsp;The elders of the Jews, for their part,
    prospered with their building, inspired by Haggai the prophet and Zechariah
    son of Iddo. They finished the building in accordance with the order of the
    God of Israel and the order of Cyrus and of Darius. &nbsp;this Temple was
    finished on the twenty-third day of the month of Adar; it was the sixth year
    of the reign of King Darius. &nbsp;The Israelites-the priests, the Levites
    and the remainder of the exiles-joyfully dedicated this Temple of God;
    &nbsp;for the dedication of this Temple of God they offered one hundred
    bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs and, as a sacrifice for sin for
    the whole of Israel, twelve he-goats, corresponding to the number of the
    tribes of Israel. &nbsp;Then they installed the priests according to their
    orders in the service of the Temple of God in Jerusalem, as is written in
    the Book of Moses. &nbsp;The exiles celebrated the Passover on the
    fourteenth day of the first month. &nbsp;The Levites, as one man, had
    purified themselves; all were pure, so they sacrificed the passover for all
    the exiles, for their brothers the priests and for themselves.

    Like flowing water is the heart of the king in the hand of the Lord, who
    turns it where he pleases. &nbsp;A man's conduct may strike him as upright,
    Lord, however, weighs the heart. &nbsp;To act virtuously and with justice is
    more pleasing to the Lord than sacrifice. &nbsp;Haughty eye, proud heart,
    lamp of the wicked, nothing but sin. &nbsp;The hardworking man is
    thoughtful, and all is gain; too much haste, and all that comes of it is
    want. &nbsp;To make a fortune with the help of a lying tongue, such the idle
    fantasy of those who look for death. &nbsp;The wicked man's soul is intent
    on evil, he looks on his neighbour with dislike. &nbsp;When a mocker is
    punished, the ignorant man grows wiser, when a wise man is instructed he
    acquires more knowledge. &nbsp;The Just One watches the house of the wicked:
    he hurls the wicked to destruction. &nbsp;He who shuts his ear to the poor

    In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the
    word of the Lord was addressed through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son
    of Shealtiel, high commissioner of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak,
    the high priest, as follows, &nbsp;'The Lord of hosts says this, "This
    people says: The time has not yet come to rebuild the Temple of the Lord.
    &nbsp;Is this a time for you to live in your panelled houses, when this
    House lies in ruins? &nbsp;So now, the Lord of hosts says this: Reflect
    carefully how things have gone for you. &nbsp;You have sown much and
    harvested little; you eat but never have enough, drink but never have your
    fill, put on clothes but do not feel warm. The wage earner gets his wages
    only to put them in a purse riddled with holes. &nbsp;So go to the hill
    country, fetch wood, and rebuild the House: I shall then take pleasure in
    it, and be glorified there, says the Lord.

    Vanity of vanities, the Preacher says. Vanity of vanities. All is vanity!
    &nbsp;For all his toil, his toil under the sun, what does man gain by it?
    &nbsp;A generation goes, a generation comes, yet the earth stands firm for
    ever. &nbsp;The sun rises, the sun sets; then to its place it speeds and
    there it rises. &nbsp;Southward goes the wind, then turns to the north; it
    turns and turns again; back then to its circling goes the wind. &nbsp;Into
    the sea all the rivers go, and yet the sea is never filled, and still to
    their goal the rivers go. &nbsp;All things are wearisome. No man can say
    that eyes have not had enough of seeing, ears their fill of hearing.
    &nbsp;What was will be again; what has been done will be done again; and
    there is nothing new under the sun. &nbsp;Take anything of which it may be
    said, 'Look now, this is new'. Already, long before our time, it existed.
    &nbsp;Only no memory remains of earlier times, just as in times to come next
    year itself will not be remembered.

    answered, 'John the Baptist; others Elijah; and others say one of the
    ancient prophets come back to life'. &nbsp;'But you,' he said 'who do you

    Rejoice in your youth, you who are young; let your heart give you joy in
    your young days. Follow the promptings of your heart and the desires of your
    eyes. But this you must know: for all these things God will bring you to
    judgment. &nbsp;Cast worry from your heart, shield your flesh from pain. Yet
    youth, the age of dark hair, is vanity. &nbsp;Remember your creator in the
    days of your youth, before evil days come and the years approach when you
    say, 'These give me no pleasure', &nbsp;before sun and light and moon and
    stars grow dark, and the clouds return after the rain; &nbsp;the day when
    those who keep the house tremble and strong men are bowed; when the women
    grind no longer at the mill, because day is darkening at the windows
    &nbsp;and the street doors are shut; when the sound of the mill is faint,
    when the voice of the bird is silenced, and song notes are stilled,
    &nbsp;when to go uphill is an ordeal and a walk is something to dread. Yet
    the almond tree is in flower, the grasshopper is heavy with food and the
    caper bush bears its fruit, while man goes to his everlasting home. And the
    mourners are already walking to and fro in the street &nbsp;before the
    silver cord has snapped, or the golden lamp been broken, or the pitcher
    shattered at the spring, or the pulley cracked at the well, &nbsp;Or before
    the dust returns to the earth as it once came from it; and the breath to God

    At a time when everyone was full of admiration for all he did, Jesus said to
    his disciples, &nbsp;'For your part, you must have these words constantly in
    your mind: The Son of Man is going to be handed over into the power of men'.
    &nbsp;But they did not understand him when he said this; it was hidden from
    them so that they should not see the meaning of it, and they were afraid to
    ask him about what he had just said.
