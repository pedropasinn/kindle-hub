    Hence, now there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For
    the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed you from the law of
    sin and death. For what the law, weakened by the flesh, was powerless to do,
    this God has done: by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh
    and for the sake of sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, so that the
    righteous decree of the law might be fulfilled in us, who live not according
    to the flesh but according to the spirit.

    The whole group of believers was united, heart and soul; no one claimed for
    his own use anything that he had, as everything they owned was held in
    common. The apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord
    Jesus with great power, and they were all given great respect. None of their
    members was ever in want, as all those who owned land or houses would sell
    them, and bring the money from them, to present it to the apostles; it was
    then distributed to any members who might be in need.

    Jesus made a tour through all the towns and villages, teaching in their
    synagogues, proclaiming the Good News of the kingdom and curing all kinds of
    diseases and sickness. And when he saw the crowds he felt sorry for them
    because they were harassed and dejected, like sheep without a shepherd. Then
    he said to his disciples, 'The harvest is rich but the labourers are few, so
    ask the Lord of the harvest to send labourers to his harvest'. He summoned
    his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits with
    power to cast them out and to cure all kinds of diseases and sickness.

    Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a
    high mountain where they could be alone. There in their presence he was
    transfigured: his face shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as
    the light. Suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared to them; they were talking
    with him. Then Peter spoke to Jesus. 'Lord,' he said 'it is wonderful for us
    to be here; if you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for
    Moses and one for Elijah.' He was still speaking when suddenly a bright
    cloud covered them with shadow, and from the cloud there came a voice which
    said, 'This is my Son, the Beloved; he enjoys my favour. Listen to him.'
    When they heard this the disciples fell on their faces overcome with fear.
    But Jesus came up and touched them. 'Stand up,' he said 'do not be afraid.'
    And when they raised their eyes they saw no one but only Jesus. As they came
    down from the mountain Jesus gave them this order, 'Tell no one about the
    vision until the Son of Man has risen from the dead'.

    suddenly, when they looked round, they saw no one with them any more but

    one what they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
    They observed the warning faithfully, though among themselves they discussed

    Jesus took with him Peter and John and James and went up the mountain to
    pray. As he prayed, the aspect of his face was changed and his clothing
    became brilliant as lightning. Suddenly there were two men there talking to
    him; they were Moses and Elijah appearing in glory, and they were speaking
    of his passing which he was to accomplish in Jerusalem. Peter and his
    companions were heavy with sleep, but they kept awake and saw his glory and
    the two men standing with him. As these were leaving him, Peter said to
    Jesus, 'Master, it is wonderful for us to be here; so let us make three
    tents, one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah'. - He did not know
    what he was saying. As he spoke, a cloud came and covered them with shadow;
    and when they went into the cloud the disciples were afraid. And a voice
    came from the cloud saying, 'This is my Son, the Chosen One. Listen to him.'
    And after the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. The disciples kept
    silence and, at that time, told no one what they had seen.

    As for me, brothers, when I came to you, it was not with any show of oratory
    or philosophy, but simply to tell you what God had guaranteed. During my
    stay with you, the only knowledge I claimed to have was about Jesus, and
    only about him as the crucified Christ. Far from relying on any power of my
    own, I came among you in great 'fear and trembling' and in my speeches and
    the sermons that I gave, there were none of the arguments that belong to
    philosophy; only a demonstration of the power of the Spirit. And I did this
    so that your faith should not depend on human philosophy but on the power of
    God. But still we have a wisdom to offer those who have reached maturity:
    not a philosophy of our age, it is true, still less of the masters of our
    age, which are coming to their end. The hidden wisdom of God which we teach
    in our mysteries is the wisdom that God predestined to be for our glory
    before the ages began. lt is a wisdom that none of the masters of this age
    have ever known, or they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory; we
    teach what scripture calls: the things that no eye has seen and no ear has
    heard, things beyond the mind of man, all that God has prepared for those
    who love him. These are the very things that God has revealed to us through
    the Spirit.

    to the blessings which God can send you - he will make sure that you will
    always have all you need for yourselves in every possible circumstance, and
    still have something to spare for all sorts of good works. As scripture
    says: He was free in almsgiving, and gave to the poor: his good deeds will
    never be forgotten. The one who provides seed for the sower and bread for

    Jesus said to his disciples: I tell you, most solemnly, unless a wheat grain
    falls on the ground and dies, it remains only a single grain; but if it
    dies, it yields a rich harvest. Anyone who loves his life loses it; anyone
    who hates his life in this world will keep it for the eternal life. If a man
    serves me, he must follow me, wherever I am, my servant will be there too.
    If anyone serves me, my Father will honour him.

    Then David gathered all Israel together in Jerusalem to bring the ark of God
    up to the place he had prepared for it.&nbsp;David called together the sons
    of Aaron and the sons of Levi,&nbsp;and the Levites carried the ark of God
    with the shafts on their shoulders, as Moses had ordered in accordance with
    the word of the Lord.&nbsp;David then told the heads of the Levites to
    assign duties for their kinsmen as cantors, with their various instruments

    with the sun, standing on the moon, and with the twelve stars on her head

    of childbirth.&nbsp;Then a second sign appeared in the sky, a huge red
    dragon which had seven heads and ten horns, and each of the seven heads
    crowned with a coronet.&nbsp;Its tail dragged a third of the stars from the
    sky and dropped them to the earth, and the dragon stopped in front of the
    woman as she was having the child, so that he could eat it as soon as it was
    born from its mother.&nbsp;The woman brought a male child into the world,
    the son who was to rule all the nations with an iron sceptre, and the child
    was taken straight up to God and to his throne,&nbsp;while the woman escaped
    into the desert, where God had made a place of safety ready, for her to be

    Mary set out at that time and went as quickly as she could to a town in the
    hill country of Judah.&nbsp;She went into Zechariah's house and greeted
    Elizabeth.&nbsp;Now as soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child
    leapt in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;She
    gave a loud cry and said, 'Of all women you are the most blessed, and
    blessed is the fruit of your womb.&nbsp;Why should I be honoured with a
    visit from the mother of my Lord?&nbsp;For the moment your greeting reached
    my ears, the child in my womb leapt for joy.&nbsp;Yes, blessed is she who
    believed that the promise made her by the Lord would be fulfilled.'&nbsp;And
    Mary said: 'My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord&nbsp;and my spirit
    exults in God my saviour;&nbsp;because he has looked upon his lowly
    handmaid. Yes, from this day forward all generations will call me
    blessed,&nbsp;for the Almighty has done great things for me. Holy is his
    name,&nbsp;and his mercy reaches from age to age for those who fear
    him.&nbsp;He has shown the power of his arm, he has routed the proud of

    lowly.&nbsp;The hungry he has filled with good things, the rich sent empty
    away.&nbsp;He has come to the help of Israel his servant, mindful of his
    mercy&nbsp;-according to the promise he made to our ancestors-of his mercy
    to Abraham and to his descendants for ever.'&nbsp;Mary stayed with Elizabeth

    Jesus spoke this parable to his disciples: A man on his way abroad summoned
    his servants and entrusted his property to them.&nbsp;To one he gave five
    talents, to another two, to a third one; each in proportion to his ability.
    Then he set out. &nbsp;The man who had received the five talents promptly
    went and traded with them and made five more. &nbsp;The man who had received
    two made two more in the same way. &nbsp;But the man who had received one
    went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money. &nbsp;Now
    a long time after, the master of those servants came back and went through
    his accounts with them. &nbsp;The man who had received the five talents came
    forward bringing five more. "Sir," he said "you entrusted me with five
    talents; here are five more that I have made." &nbsp;His master said to him,
    "Well done, good and faithful servant; you have shown you can be faithful in
    small things, I will trust you with greater; come and join in your master's
    happiness". &nbsp;Next the man with the two talents came forward. "Sir," he
    said "you entrusted me with two talents; here are two more that I have
    made." &nbsp;His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant;
    you have shown you can be faithful in small things, I will trust you with
    greater; come and join in your master's happiness". &nbsp;Last came forward
    the man who had the one talent. "Sir," said he "I had heard you were a hard
    man, reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not
    scattered; &nbsp;so I was afraid, and I went off and hid your talent in the
    ground. Here it is; it was yours, you have it back." &nbsp;But his master
    answered him, "You wicked and lazy servant! So you knew that I reap where I
    have not sown and gather where I have not scattered? &nbsp;Well then, you
    should have deposited my money with the bankers, and on my return I would
    have recovered my capital with interest. &nbsp;So now, take the talent from
    him and give it to the man who has the five talents. &nbsp;For to everyone
    who has will be given more, and he will have more than enough; but from the
    man who has not, even what he has will be taken away. &nbsp;As for this
    good-for-nothing servant, throw him out into the dark, where there will be

    It was our God who gave us the courage to proclaim his Good News to you in
    the face of great opposition. We have not taken to preaching because we are
    deluded, or immoral, or trying to deceive anyone; it was God who decided
    that we were fit to be entrusted with the Good News, and when we are
    speaking, we are not trying to please men but God, who can read our inmost
    thoughts. You know very well, and we can swear it before God, that never at
    any time have our speeches been simply flattery, or a cover for trying to
    get money; nor have we ever looked for any special honour from men, either
    from you or anybody else, when we could have imposed ourselves on you with
    full weight, as apostles of Christ. Instead, we were unassuming. Like a
    mother feeding and looking after her own children, we felt so devoted and
    protective towards you, and had come to love you so much, that we were eager
    to hand over to you not only the Good News but our whole lives as well.

    Jesus showed himself to his disciples, and after they had eaten he said to
    Simon Peter, 'Simon son of John, do you love me more than these others do?'
    He answered, 'Yes Lord, you know I love you'. Jesus said to him, 'Feed my
    lambs'. A second time he said to him, 'Simon son of John, do you love me?'
    He replied, 'Yes, Lord, you know I love you'. Jesus said to him, 'Look after
    my sheep'. Then he said to him a third time, 'Simon son of John, do you love
    me?' Peter was upset that he asked him the third time, 'Do you love me?' and
    said, 'Lord, you know everything; you know I love you'. Jesus said to him,

    Philip found Nathanael and said to him, 'We have found the one Moses wrote

    Be ambitious for the higher gifts. And I am going to show you a way that is
    better than any of them. If I have all the eloquence of men or of angels,
    but speak without love, I am simply a gong booming or a cymbal clashing. If
    I have the gift of prophecy, understanding all the mysteries there are, and
    knowing everything, and if I have faith in all its fullness, to move
    mountains, but without love, then I am nothing at all. If I give away all
    that I possess, piece by piece, and if I even let them take my body to burn
    it, but am without love, it will do me no good whatever. Love is always
    patient and kind; it is never jealous; love is never boastful or conceited;
    it is never rude or selfish; it does not take offence, and is not resentful.
    &nbsp;Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins but delights in the
    truth; it is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure
    whatever comes. Love does not come to an end. But if there are gifts of
    prophecy, the time will come when they must fail; or the gift of languages,
    it will not continue for ever; and knowledge - for this, too, the time will
    come when it must fail. &nbsp;For our knowledge is imperfect and our
    prophesying is imperfect; but once perfection comes, all imperfect things
    will disappear. When I was a child, I used to talk like a child, and think
    like a child, and argue like a child, but now I am a man, all childish ways
    are put behind me. Now we are seeing a dim reflection in a mirror; but then
    we shall be seeing face to face. The knowledge that I have now is imperfect;
    but then I shall know as fully as I am known. &nbsp;In short, there are
    three things that last: faith, hope and love; and the greatest of these is
    love.

    Jesus went to a town called Nain, accompanied by his disciples and a great
    number of people. When he was near the gate of the town it happened that a
    dead man was being carried out for burial, the only son of his mother, and
    she was a widow. And a considerable number of the townspeople were with her.
    When the Lord saw her he felt sorry for her. 'Do not cry' he said. Then he
    went up and put his hand on the bier and the bearers stood still, and he
    said, 'Young man, I tell you to get up'. And the dead man sat up and began
    to talk, and Jesus gave him to his mother. Everyone was filled with awe and
    praised God saying, 'A great prophet has appeared among us; God has visited
    his people'. And this opinion of him spread throughout Judaea and all over
    the countryside.

    Herod had sent to have John arrested, and had him chained up in prison
    because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife whom he had married.
    &nbsp;For John had told Herod, 'It is against the law for you to have your
    brother's wife'. &nbsp;As for Herodias, she was furious with him and wanted
    to kill him; but she was not able to, &nbsp;because Herod was afraid of
    John, knowing him to be a good and holy man, and gave him his protection.
    When he had heard him speak he was greatly perplexed, and yet he liked to
    listen to him. &nbsp;An opportunity came on Herod's birthday when he gave a
    banquet for the nobles of his court, for his army officers and for the
    leading figures in Galilee. &nbsp;When the daughter of this same Herodias
    came in and danced, she delighted Herod and his guests; so the king said to
    the girl, 'Ask me anything you like and I will give it you'. &nbsp;And he
    swore her an oath, 'I will give you anything you ask, even half my kingdom'.
    &nbsp;She went out and said to her mother, 'What shall I ask for?' She
    replied, 'The head of John the Baptist' &nbsp;The girl hurried straight back
    to the king and made her request, 'I want you to give me John the Baptist's
    head, here and now, on a dish'. &nbsp;The king was deeply distressed but,
    thinking of the oaths he had sworn and of his guests, he was reluctant to
    break his word to her. &nbsp;So the king at once sent one of the bodyguard
    with orders to bring John's head. &nbsp;The man went off and beheaded him in
    prison; then he brought the head on a dish and gave it to the girl, and the
    girl gave it to her mother. &nbsp;When John's disciples heard about this,
    they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
