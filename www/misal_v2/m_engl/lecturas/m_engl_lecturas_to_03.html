    In days past the Lord humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
    but in days to come he will confer glory on the Way of the Sea on the far
    side of Jordan, province of the nations. The people that walked in darkness
    has seen a great light; on those who live in a land of deep shadow a light
    has shone. You have made their gladness greater, you have made their joy
    increase; they rejoice in your presence as men rejoice at harvest time, as
    men are happy when they are dividing the spoils. For the yoke that was
    weighing on him, the bar across his shoulders, the rod of his oppressor,
    these you break as on the day of Midian.

    I appeal to you, brothers, for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ, to make up
    the differences between you, and instead of disagreeing among yourselves, to
    be united again in your belief and practice. From what Chloe's people have
    been telling me, my dear brothers, it is clear that there are serious
    differences among you. What I mean are all these slogans that you have,
    like: 'I am for Paul', 'I am for Apollos', 'I am for Cephas', 'I am for
    Christ'. Has Christ been parcelled out? Was it Paul that was crucified for
    you? Were you baptised in the name of Paul? For Christ did not send me to
    baptise, but to preach the Good News, and not to preach that in the terms of
    philosophy in which the crucifixion of Christ cannot be expressed.

    Hearing that John had been arrested Jesus went back to Galilee, and leaving
    Nazareth he went and settled in Capernaum, a lakeside town on the borders of
    Zebulun and Naphtali. In this way the prophecy of Isaiah was to be
    fulfilled: ' Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Way of the sea on the far
    side of Jordan, Galilee of the nations! The people that lived in darkness
    has seen a great light; on those who dwell in the land and shadow of death a
    light has dawned.' From that moment Jesus began his preaching with the
    message, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is close at hand'. As he was
    walking by the Sea of Galilee he saw two brothers, Simon, who was called
    Peter, and his brother Andrew; they were making a cast in the lake with
    their net, for they were fishermen. And he said to them, 'Follow me and I
    will make you fishers of men'. And they left their nets at once and followed
    him. Going on from there he saw another pair of brothers, James son of
    Zebedee and his brother John; they were in their boat with their father
    Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them. At once, leaving the boat
    and their father, they followed him. He went round the whole of Galilee
    teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the Good News of the kingdom and
    curing all kinds of diseases and sickness among the people.

    The word of the Lord was addressed to Jonah: 'Up!' he said 'Go to Nineveh,
    the great city, and preach to them as I told you to.' Jonah set out and went
    to Nineveh in obedience to the word of the Lord. Now Nineveh was a city
    great beyond compare: it took three days to cross it. Jonah went on into the
    city, making a day's journey. He preached in these words, 'Only forty days
    more and Nineveh is going to be destroyed'. And the people of Nineveh
    believed in God; they proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth, from the
    greatest to the least. God saw their efforts to renounce their evil
    behaviour. And God relented: he did not inflict on them the disaster which
    he had threatened.

    After John had been arrested, Jesus went into Galilee. There he proclaimed
    the Good News from God. 'The time has come' he said 'and the kingdom of God
    is close at hand. Repent, and believe the Good News.' As he was walking
    along by the Sea of Galileehe saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net
    in the lake - for they were fishermen. And Jesus said to them, 'Follow me
    and I will make you into fishers of men'. And at once they left their nets
    and followed him. Going on a little further, he saw James son of Zebedee and
    his brother John; they too were in their boat, mending their nets. He called
    them at once and, leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the men he
    employed, they went after him.

    Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly, consisting of men,
    women, and children old enough to understand. This was the first day of the
    seventh month. On the square before the Water Gate, in the presence of the
    men and women, and children old enough to understand, he read from the book
    from early morning till noon; all the people listened attentively to the
    Book of the Law. Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden dais erected for the
    purpose. In full view of all the people-since he stood higher than all the
    people-Ezra opened the book; and when he opened it all the people stood up.
    Then Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God, and all the people raised their
    hands and answered, 'Amen! Amen!'; then they bowed down and, face to the
    ground, prostrated themselves before the lord. And Ezra read from the Law of
    God, translating and giving the sense, so that the people understood what
    was read. Then (Nehemiah-His Excellency-and) Ezra, priest and scribe (and
    the Levites who were instructing the people) said to all the people, 'This
    day is sacred to the Lord your God. Do not be mournful, do not weep.' For
    the people were all in tears as they listened to the words of the Law. He
    then said, 'Go, eat the fat, drink the sweet wine, and send a portion to the
    man who has nothing prepared ready. For this day is sacred to our Lord. Do
    not be sad: the joy of the Lord is your stronghold.'

    Just as a human body, though it is made up of many parts, is a single unit
    because all these parts, though many, make one body, so it is with Christ.
    In the one Spirit we were all baptised, Jews as well as Greeks, slaves as
    well as citizens, and one Spirit was given to us all to drink. Nor is the
    body to be identified with any one of its many parts. If the foot were to
    say, 'I am not a hand and so I do not belong to the body', would that mean
    that it stopped being part of the body? If the ear were to say, 'I am not an
    eye, and so I do not belong to the body', would that mean that it was not a
    part of the body? If your whole body was just one eye, how would you hear
    anything? If it was just one ear, how would you smell anything? Instead of
    that, God put all the separate parts into the body on purpose. If all the
    parts were the same, how could it be a body? As it is, the parts are many
    but the body is one. The eye cannot say to the hand, 'I do not need you',
    nor can the head say to the feet, 'I do not need you'. What is more, it is
    precisely the parts of the body that seem to be the weakest which are the
    indispensable ones; and it is the least honourable parts of the body that we
    clothe with the greatest care. So our more improper parts get decorated in a
    way that our more proper parts do not need. God has arranged the body so
    that more dignity is given to the parts which are without it, &nbsp;and that
    there may not be disagreements inside the body, but that each part may be
    equally concerned for all the others. If one part is hurt, all parts are
    hurt with it. If one part is given special honour, all parts enjoy it. Now
    you together are Christ's body; but each of you is a different part of it.
    In the Church, God has given the first place to apostles, the second to
    prophets, the third to teachers; after them, miracles, and after them the
    gift of healing; helpers, good leaders, those with many languages. Are all
    of them apostles, or all of them prophets, or all of them teachers? Do they
    all have the gift of miracles, or all have the gift of healing? Do all speak
    strange languages, and all interpret them?

    Seeing that many others have undertaken to draw up accounts of the events
    that have taken place among us, exactly as these were handed down to us by
    those who from the outset were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word, I in
    my turn, after carefully going over the whole story from the beginning, have
    decided to write an ordered account for you, Theophilus, so that your
    Excellency may learn how well founded the teaching is that you have
    received. Jesus, with the power of the Spirit in him, returned to Galilee;
    and his reputation spread throughout the countryside. He taught in their
    synagogues and everyone praised him. He came to Nazara, where he had been
    brought up, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day as he usually
    did. He stood up to read and they handed him the scroll of the prophet
    Isaiah. Unrolling the scroll he found the place where it is written: The
    spirit of the Lord has been given to me, for he has anointed me. He has sent
    me to bring the good news to the poor, to proclaim liberty to captives and
    to the blind new sight, to set the downtrodden free, to proclaim the Lord's
    year of favour. &nbsp;He then rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the
    assistant and sat down. And all eyes in the synagogue were fixed on him.
    Then he began to speak to them, 'This text is being fulfilled today even as
    you listen'.

  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    Christ brings a new covenant, as the mediator, only so that the people who
    were called to an eternal inheritance may actually receive what was
    promised: his death took place to cancel the sins that infringed the earlier
    covenant. It is not as though Christ had entered a man-made sanctuary which
    was only modelled on the real one; but it was heaven itself, so that he
    could appear in the actual presence of God on our behalf. And he does not
    have to offer himself again and again, like the high priest going into the
    sanctuary year after year with the blood that is not his own, or else he
    would have had to suffer over and over again since the world began. Instead
    of that, he has made his appearance once and for all, now at the end of the
    last age, to do away with sin by sacrificing himself. Since men only die
    once, and after that comes judgement, so Christ, too, offers himself only
    once to take the faults of many on himself, and when he appears a second
    time, it will not be to deal with sin but to reward with salvation those who

    All the tribes of Israel then came to David at Hebron. 'Look' they said 'we
    are your own flesh and blood. In days past when Saul was our king, it was
    you who led Israel in all their exploits; and the Lord said to you, "You are
    the man who shall be shepherd of my people Israel, you shall be the leader
    of Israel ".' So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and
    King David made a pact with them at Hebron in the presence of the Lord, and
    they anointed David king of Israel. David was thirty years old when he
    became king, and he reigned for forty years. He reigned in Hebron over Judah
    for seven years and six months; then he reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
    and Judah for thirty-three years. David and his men marched on Jerusalem
    against the Jebusites living there. These said to David, 'You will not get
    in here. The blind and the lame will hold you off.' (That is to say: David
    will never get in here.) &nbsp;But David captured the fortress of Zion, that
    is, the Citadel of David. He grew greater and greater, and the Lord, God of
    hosts, was with him.

    The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, 'Beelzebul is in
    him' and, 'It is through the prince of devils that he casts devils out'. So
    Jesus called them to him and spoke to them in parables, 'How can Satan cast
    out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot last.
    And if a household is divided against itself, that household can never
    stand. Now if Satan has rebelled against himself and is divided, he cannot
    stand either - it is the end of him. But no one can make his way into a
    strong man's house and burgle his property unless he has tied up the strong
    man first. Only then can he burgle his house. 'I tell you solemnly, all
    men's sins will be forgiven, and all their blasphemies; but let anyone
    blaspheme against the Holy Spirit and he will never have forgiveness: he is
    guilty of an eternal sin.' &nbsp;This was because they were saying, 'An
    unclean spirit is in him'.

    Since the Law has no more than a reflection of these realities, and no
    finished picture of them, it is quite incapable of bringing the worshippers
    to perfection, with the same sacrifices repeatedly offered year after year.
    Otherwise, the offering of them would have stopped, because the worshippers,
    when they had been purified once, would have no awareness of sins. Instead
    of that, the sins are recalled year after year in the sacrifices. Bulls'
    blood and goats' blood are useless for taking away sins, and this is what he
    said, on coming into the world: You who wanted no sacrifice or oblation,
    prepared a body for me. You took no pleasure in holocausts or sacrifices for
    sin; then I said, just as I was commanded in the scroll of the book, 'God,
    here I am! I am coming to obey your will.' Notice that he says first: You
    did not want what the Law lays down as the things to be offered, that is:
    the sacrifices, the oblations, the holocausts and the sacrifices for sin,
    and you took no pleasure in them; and then he says: Here I am! I am coming
    to obey your will. He is abolishing the first sort to replace it with the
    second. &nbsp;And this will was for us to be made holy by the offering of
    his body made once and for all by Jesus Christ.

    David went and brought the ark of God up from Obed-edom's house to the
    Citadel of David with great rejoicing. When the bearers of the ark of the
    Lord had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fat sheep. And David
    danced whirling round before the Lord with all his might, wearing a linen
    loincloth round him. Thus David and all the House of Israel brought up the
    ark of the Lord with acclaim and the sound of the horn. They brought the ark
    of the Lord in and put it in position inside the tent that David had pitched
    for it; and David offered holocausts before the Lord, and communion
    sacrifices. &nbsp;And when David had finished offering holocausts and

    All the priests stand at their duties every day, offering over and over
    again the same sacrifices which are quite incapable of taking sins away. He,
    on the other hand, has offered one single sacrifice for sins, and then taken
    his place forever, at the right hand of God, where he is now waiting until
    his enemies are made into a footstool for him. By virtue of that one single
    offering, he has achieved the eternal perfection of all whom he is
    sanctifying. The Holy Spirit assures us of this; for he says, first: This is

    The word of the Lord came to Nathan: 'Go and tell my servant David, "Thus
    the Lord speaks: Are you the man to build me a house to dwell in? &nbsp;I
    have never stayed in a house from the day I brought the Israelites out of
    Egypt until today, but have always led a wanderer's life in a tent. In all
    my journeying with the whole people of Israel, did I say to any one of the
    judges of Israel, whom I had appointed as shepherds of Israel my people: Why
    have you not built me a house of cedar?" This is what you must say to my
    servant David, "The Lord of hosts says this: I took you from the pasture,
    from following the sheep, to be leader of my people Israel; I have been with
    you on all your expeditions; I have cut off all your enemies before you. I
    will give you fame as great as the fame of the greatest on earth. I will
    provide a place for my people Israel; I will plant them there and they shall
    dwell in that place and never be disturbed again; nor shall the wicked
    continue to oppress them as they did, in the days when I appointed judges
    over my people Israel; I will give them rest from all their enemies. The
    Lord will make you great; the Lord will make you a House. And when your days
    are ended and you are laid to rest with your ancestors, I will preserve the
    offspring of your body after you and make his sovereignty secure. (It is he
    who shall build a house for my name, and I will make his royal throne secure
    for ever.) I will be a father to him and he a son to me; if he does evil, I
    will punish him with the rod such as men use, with strokes such as mankind
    gives. &nbsp;Yet I will not withdraw my favour from him, as I withdrew it
    from your predecessor. &nbsp;Your House and your sovereignty will always

    Jesus began to teach by the lakeside, but such a huge crowd gathered round
    him that he got into a boat on the lake and sat there. The people were all
    along the shore, at the water's edge. He taught them many things in
    parables, and in the course of his teaching he said to them, 'Listen!,
    Imagine a sower going out to sow. Now it happened that, as he sowed, some of
    the seed fell on the edge of the path, and the birds came and ate it up.
    Some seed fell on rocky ground where it found little soil and sprang up
    straightaway, because there was no depth of earth; and when the sun came up
    it was scorched and, not having any roots, it withered away. Some seed fell
    into thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it produced no crop.
    And some seeds fell into rich soil and, growing tall and strong, produced
    crop; and yielded thirty, sixty, even a hundredfold.' And he said, 'Listen,
    anyone who has ears to hear!' When he was alone, the Twelve, together with
    the others who formed his company, asked what the parables meant. He told
    them, 'The secret of the kingdom of God is given to you, but to those who
    are outside everything comes in parables, so that they may see and see
    again, but not perceive; may hear and hear again, but not understand;
    otherwise they might be converted and be forgiven'. He said to them, 'Do you
    not understand this parable? Then how will you understand any of the
    parables? What the sower is sowing is the word. Those on the edge of the
    path where the word is sown are people who have no sooner heard it than
    Satan comes and carries away the word that was sown in them. Similarly,
    those who receive the seed on patches of rock are people who, when first
    they hear the word, welcome it at once with joy. But they have no root in
    them, they do not last; should some trial come, or some persecution on
    account of the word, they fall away at once. Then there are others who
    receive the seed in thorns. These have heard the word, but the worries of
    this world, the lure of riches and all the other passions come in to choke
    the word, and so it produces nothing. And there are those who have received
    the seed in rich soil: they hear the word and accept it and yield a harvest,
    thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.'

    Through the blood of Jesus we have the right to enter the sanctuary, by a
    new way which he has opened for us, a living opening through the curtain,
    that is to say, his body. And we have the supreme high priest over all the
    house of God. So as we go in, let us be sincere in heart and filled with
    faith, our minds sprinkled and free from any trace of bad conscience and our
    bodies washed with pure water. Let us keep firm in the hope we profess,
    because the one who made the promise is faithful. Let us be concerned for
    each other, to stir a response in love and good works. Do not stay away from
    the meetings of the community, as some do, but encourage each other to go;
    the more so as you see the Day drawing near.

    After Nathan had spoken to David, the King went in and, seated before the
    Lord, said: 'Who am I, Lord, and what is my House, that you have led me as
    far as this? Yet in your sight, Lord, this is still not far enough, and you
    make your promises extend to the House of your servant for a far-distant
    future... You have constituted your people Israel to be your own people for
    ever; and you, Lord, have become their God. Now, Lord, always keep the
    promise you have made your servant and his House, and do as you have said.
    Your name will be exalted for ever and men will say, "The Lord of hosts is
    God over Israel." The House of your servant David will be made secure in
    your presence, since you yourself, Lord of hosts, God of Israel, have made
    this revelation to your servant, "I will build you a House"; hence your
    servant has ventured to offer this prayer to you. Yes, Lord, you are God
    indeed, your words are true and you have made this fair promise to your
    servant. Be pleased, then, to bless the House of your servant, that it may
    continue for ever in your presence; for you, Lord, have spoken; and with

    Jesus said to the crowd: 'Would you bring in a lamp to put it under a tub or

    nothing hidden but it must be disclosed, nothing kept secret except to be
    brought to light. If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen to this.' He

    Remember all the sufferings that you had to meet after you received the
    light, in earlier days; sometimes by being yourselves publicly exposed to
    insults and violence, and sometimes as associates of others who were treated
    in the same way. For you not only shared in the sufferings of those who were
    in prison, but you happily accepted being stripped of your belongings,
    knowing that you owned something that was better and lasting. Be as
    confident now, then, since the reward is so great. You will need endurance
    to do God's will and gain what he has promised. Only a little while now, a
    very little while, and the one that is coming will have come; he will not
    delay. The righteous man will live by faith, but if he draws back, my soul
    will take no pleasure in him. You and I are not the sort of people who draw

    At the turn of the year, the time when kings go campaigning, David sent Joab
    and with him his own guards and the whole of Israel. They massacred the
    Ammonites and laid siege to Rabbah. David however remained in Jerusalem. It
    happened towards evening when David had risen from his couch and was
    strolling on the palace roof, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; the
    woman was very beautiful. David made inquiries about this woman and was
    told, 'Why, that is Bathsheba, Eliam's daughter, the wife of Uriah the
    Hittite.' Then David sent messengers and had her brought. She came to him,
    and he slept with her; now she had just purified herself from her courses.
    She then went home again. The woman conceived and sent word to David, 'I am
    with child'. Then David sent Joab a message, 'Send me Uriah the Hittite',
    whereupon Joab sent Uriah to David. When Uriah came into his presence, David
    asked after Joab and the army and how the war was going. David then said to
    Uriah, 'Go down to your house and enjoy yourself'. Uriah left the palace,
    and was followed by a present from the king's table. Uriah however slept by
    the palace door with his master's bodyguard and did not go down to his
    house. This was reported to David; 'Uriah' they said 'did not go down to his
    house'. So David asked Uriah, 'Have you not just arrived from a journey? Why
    do you not go to your home?' The next day David invited him to eat and drink
    in his presence and made him drunk. In the evening Uriah went out and lay on
    his couch with his master's bodyguard, but he did not go down to his house.
    Next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by Uriah. In the
    letter he wrote, 'Station Uriah in the thick of the fight and then fall back
    behind him so that he may be struck down and die'. Joab, then besieging the
    town, posted Uriah in a place where he knew there were fierce fighters. The
    men of the town sallied out and engaged Joab; the army suffered casualties,
    including some of David's bodyguard; and Uriah the Hittite was killed too.

    Jesus said to the crowds: 'This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man
    throws seed on the land. Night and day, while he sleeps, when he is awake,
    the seed is sprouting and growing; how, he does not know. Of its own accord
    the land produces first the shoot, then the ear, then the full grain in the
    ear. And when the crop is ready, he loses no time: he starts to reap because
    the harvest has come.' He also said, 'What can we say the kingdom of God is
    like? What parable can we find for it? It is like a mustard seed which at
    the time of its sowing in the soil is the smallest of all the seeds on
    earth; yet once it is sown it grows into the biggest shrub of them all and
    puts out big branches so that the birds of the air can shelter in its
    shade.' Using many parables like these, he spoke the word to them, so far as
    they were capable of understanding it. &nbsp;He would not speak to them
    except in parables, but he explained everything to his disciples when they
    were alone.

    Only faith can guarantee the blessings that we hope for, or prove the
    existence of the realities that at present remain unseen. It was for faith
    that our ancestors were commended. It was by faith that Abraham obeyed the
    call to set out for a country that was the inheritance given to him and his
    descendants, and that he set out without knowing where he was going. By
    faith he arrived, as a foreigner, in the Promised Land, and lived there as
    if in a strange country, with Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of
    the same promise. They lived there in tents while he looked forward to a
    city founded, designed and built by God. It was equally by faith that Sarah,
    in spite of being past the age, was made able to conceive, because she
    believed that he who had made the promise would be faithful to it. Because
    of this, there came from one man, and one who was already as good as dead
    himself, more descendants than could be counted, as many as the stars of
    heaven or the grains of sand on the seashore. All these died in faith,
    before receiving any of the things that had been promised, but they saw them
    in the far distance and welcomed them, recognizing that they were only
    strangers and nomads on earth. People who use such terms about themselves
    make it quite plain that they are in search of their real homeland. They can
    hardly have meant the country they came from, since they had the opportunity
    to go back to it; but in fact they were longing for a better homeland, their
    heavenly homeland. That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God,
    since he has founded the city for them. It was by faith that Abraham, when
    put to the test, offered up Isaac. He offered to sacrifice his only son even
    though the promises had been made to him and he had been told: It is through
    Isaac that your name will be carried on. &nbsp;He was confident that God had
    the power even to raise the dead; and so, figuratively speaking, he was
    given back Isaac from the dead.

  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    The Lord sent Nathan the prophet to David. He came to him and said: 'In the
    same town were two men, one rich, the other poor. The rich man had flocks
    and herds in great abundance; the poor man had nothing but a ewe lamb, one
    only, a small one he had bought. This he fed, and it grew up with him and
    his children, eating his bread, drinking from his cup, sleeping on his
    breast; it was like a daughter to him. &nbsp;When there came a traveller to
    stay, the rich man refused to take one of his own flock or herd to provide
    for the wayfarer who had come to him. Instead he took the poor man's lamb
    and prepared it for his guest.' David's anger flared up against the man. 'As
    the Lord lives,' he said to Nathan 'the man who did this deserves to die! He
    must make fourfold restitution for the lamb, for doing such a thing and
    showing no compassion.' Then Nathan said to David, 'You are the man. So now
    the sword will never be far from your House, since you have shown contempt
    for me and taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife." 'Thus the
    Lord speaks, "I will stir up evil for you out of your own House. Before your
    very eyes I will take your wives and give them to your neighbour, and he
    shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun. You worked in secret, I
    will work this in the face of all Israel and in the face of the sun."' David
    said to Nathan, 'I have sinned against the Lord'. Then Nathan said to David,
    the Lord, for his part, forgives your sin; you are not to die. Yet because
    you have outraged the Lord by doing this, the child that is born to you is
    to die.' Then Nathan went home. The Lord struck the child that Uriah's wife
    had borne to David and it fell gravely ill. David pleaded with the Lord for
    the child; he kept a strict fast and went home and spent the night on the
    bare ground, covered with sacking. The officials of his household came and
    stood round him to get him to rise from the ground, but he refused, nor
    would he take food with them.

    With the coming of evening that same day, Jesus said to his disciples, 'Let
    us cross over to the other side'. And leaving the crowd behind they took
    him, just as he was, in the boat; and there were other boats with him. Then
    it began to blow a gale and the waves were breaking into the boat so that it
    was almost swamped. But he was in the stern, his head on the cushion,
    asleep. They woke him and said to him, 'Master, do you not care? We are
    going down!' And he woke up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, 'Quiet
    now! Be calm!' And the wind dropped, and all was calm again. Then he said to
    them, 'Why are you so frightened? How is it that you have no faith?' They
    were filled with awe and said to one another, 'Who can this be? Even the
    wind and the sea obey him.'
