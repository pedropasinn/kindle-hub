    Wisdom is bright, and does not grow dim. By those who love her she is
    readily seen, and found by those who look for her. Quick to anticipate those
    who desire her, she makes herself known to them. Watch for her early and you
    will have no trouble; you will find her sitting at your gates. Even to think
    about her is understanding fully grown; be on the alert for her and anxiety
    will quickly leave you. She herself walks about looking for those who are
    worthy of her and graciously shows herself to them as they go, in every
    thought of theirs coming to meet them.

    We want you to be quite certain, brothers, about those who have died, to
    make sure that you do not grieve about them, like the other people who have
    no hope. We believe that Jesus died and rose again, and that it will be the
    same for those who have died in Jesus: God will bring them with him. We can
    tell you this from the Lord's own teaching, that any of us who are left
    alive until the Lord's coming will not have any advantage over those who
    have died. At the trumpet of God, the voice of the archangel will call out
    the command and the Lord himself will come down from heaven; those who have
    died in Christ will be the first to rise, &nbsp;and then those of us who are
    still alive will be taken up in the clouds, together with them; to meet the
    Lord in the air. So we shall stay with the Lord for ever. &nbsp;With such
    thoughts as these you should comfort one another.

    Jesus told this parable to his disciples: 'The kingdom of heaven will be
    like this: Ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
    Five of them were foolish and five were sensible: the foolish ones did take
    their lamps, but they brought no oil, whereas the sensible ones took flasks
    of oil as well as their lamps. The bridegroom was late, and they all grew
    drowsy and fell asleep. But at midnight there was a cry, "The bridegroom is
    here! Go out and meet him." At this, all those bridesmaids woke up and
    trimmed their lamps, and the foolish ones said to the sensible ones, "Give
    us some of your oil: our lamps are going out". But they replied, "There may
    not be enough for us and for you; you had better go to those who sell it and
    buy some for yourselves". They had gone off to buy it when the bridegroom
    arrived. Those who were ready went in with him to the wedding hall and the
    door was closed. The other bridesmaids arrived later. "Lord, Lord," they
    said "open the door for us." But he replied, "I tell you solemnly, I do not
    know you". So stay awake, because you do not know either the day or the
    hour.

    Elijah the Prophet went off to Sidon. And when he reached the city gate,
    there was a widow gathering sticks; addressing her he said, 'Please bring a
    little water in a vessel for me to drink'. She was setting off to bring it
    when he called after her. 'Please' he said 'bring me a scrap of bread in
    your hand.' &nbsp;'As the Lord your God lives,' she replied 'I have no baked
    bread, but only a handful of meal in a jar and a little oil in a jug; I am
    just gathering a stick or two to go and prepare this for myself and my son
    to eat, and then we shall die.' But Elijah said to her, 'Do not be afraid,
    go and do as you have said; but first make a little scone of it for me and
    bring it to me, and then make some for yourself and for your son. For thus
    the Lord speaks, the God of Israel: "Jar of meal shall not be spent, jug of
    oil shall not be emptied, before the day when the Lord sends rain on the
    face of the earth".' The woman went and did as Elijah told her and they ate
    the food, she, himself and her son. The jar of meal was not spent nor the
    jug of oil emptied, just as the Lord had foretold through Elijah.

    It is not as though Christ had entered a man-made sanctuary which was only
    modeled on the real one; but it was heaven itself, so that he could appear
    in the actual presence of God on our behalf. And he does not have to offer
    himself again and again, like the high priest going into the sanctuary year
    after year with the blood that is not his own, or else he would have had to
    suffer over and over again since the world began. Instead of that, he has
    made his appearance once and for all, now at the end of the last age, to do
    away with sin by sacrificing himself. Since men only die once, and after
    that comes judgment, so Christ, too, offers himself only once to take the
    faults of many on himself, and when he appears a second time, it will not be
    to deal with sin but to reward with salvation those who are waiting for him.

    In his teaching to the crowds Jesus said, 'Beware of the scribes who like to
    walk about in long robes, to be greeted obsequiously in the market squares,
    to take the front seats in the synagogues and the places of honour at
    banquets; these are the men who swallow the property of widows, while making
    a show of lengthy prayers. The more severe will be the sentence they
    receive.' He sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting
    money into the treasury, and many of the rich put in a great deal. A poor
    widow came and put in two small coins, the equivalent of a penny. Then he
    called his disciples and said to them, 'I tell you solemnly, this poor widow
    has put more in than all who have contributed to the treasury; for they have
    all put in money they had over, but she from the little she had has put in
    everything she possessed, all she had to live on'.

    There were seven brothers who were arrested with their mother. The king
    tried to force them to taste pig's flesh, which the Law forbids, by
    torturing them with whips and scourges. One of them, acting as spokesman for
    the others, said, 'What are you trying to find out from us? We are prepared
    to die rather than break the laws of our ancestors.' With his last breath he
    exclaimed, 'Inhuman fiend, you may discharge us from this present life, but
    the King of the world will raise us up, since it is for his laws that we
    die, to live again for ever'. After him, they amused themselves with the
    third, who on being asked for his tongue promptly thrust it out and boldly
    held out his hands, with these honourable words, 'it was heaven that gave me
    these limbs; for the sake of his laws I disdain them; from him I hope to
    receive them again'. The king and his attendants were astounded at the young
    man's courage and his utter indifference to suffering. When this one was
    dead they subjected the fourth to the same savage torture. When he neared
    his end he cried, 'Ours is the better choice, to meet death at men's hands,
    yet relying on God's promise that we shall be raised up by him; whereas for
    you there can be no resurrection, no new life'.

    Some Sadducees-those who say that there is no resurrection-approached Jesus
    and they put this question to him, 'Master, we have it from Moses in
    writing, that if a man's married brother dies childless, the man must marry
    the widow to raise up children for his brother. Well then, there were seven
    brothers. The first, having married a wife, died childless. The second and
    then the third married the widow. And the same with all seven, they died
    leaving no children. Finally the woman herself died Now, at the
    resurrection, to which of them will she be wife since she had been married
    to all seven?' Jesus replied, 'The children of this world take wives and
    husbands, but those who are judged worthy of a place in the other world and
    if the resurrection from the dead do not marry because they can no longer
    die, for they are the same as the angels, and being children of the
    resurrection they are sons of God. &nbsp;And Moses himself implies that the
    dead rise again, in the passage about the bush where he calls the Lord the
    God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. Now he is God, not of
    the dead, but of the living; for to him all men are in fact alive.'

    Love virtue, you who are judges on earth, let honesty prompt your thinking
    about the Lord, seek him in simplicity of heart; since he is to be found by
    those who do not put him to the test, he shows himself to those who do not
    distrust him. But selfish intentions divorce from God; and Omnipotence, put
    to the test, confounds the foolish. No, Wisdom will never make its way into
    a crafty soul nor stay in a body that is in debt to sin; the holy spirit of
    instruction shuns deceit, it stands aloof from reckless purposes, is taken
    aback when iniquity appears. Wisdom is a spirit, a friend to man, though she
    will not pardon the words of a blasphemer, since God sees into the innermost
    parts of him, truly observes his heart, and listens to his tongue. The
    spirit of the Lord, indeed, fills the whole world, and that which holds all
    things together knows every word that is said.

    From Paul, servant of God, an apostle of Jesus Christ to bring those whom
    God has chosen to faith and to the knowledge of the truth that leads to true
    religion; and to give them the hope of the eternal life that was promised so
    long ago by God. He does not lie and so, at the appointed time, he revealed
    his decision, and, by the command of God our saviour, I have been
    commissioned to proclaim it. To Titus, true child of mine in the faith that
    we share, wishing you grace and peace from God the Father and from Christ
    Jesus our saviour. The reason I left you behind in Crete was for you to get
    everything organised there and appoint elders in every town, in the way that
    I told you: that is, each of them must be a man of irreproachable character;
    he must not have been married more than once, and his children must be
    believers and not uncontrollable or liable to be charged with disorderly
    conduct. Since, as president, he will be God's representative, he must be
    irreproachable: never an arrogant or hot-tempered man, nor a heavy drinker
    or violent, nor out to make money; but a man who is hospitable and a friend
    of all that is good; sensible, moral, devout and self-controlled; and he
    must have a firm grasp of the unchanging message of the tradition, so that
    he can be counted on for both expounding the sound doctrine and refuting
    those who argue against it.

    Jesus said to his disciples, 'Obstacles are sure to come, but alas for the
    one who provides them! It would be better for him to be thrown into the Sea
    with a millstone put round his neck than that he should lead astray a single
    one of these little ones. Watch yourselves! 'If your brother does something
    wrong, reprove him and, if he is sorry, forgive him. And if he wrongs you
    seven times a day and seven times comes back to you and says, "I am sorry",
    you must forgive him.' The apostles said to the Lord, 'Increase our faith'.

    God did make man imperishable, he made him in the image of his own nature;
    it was the devil's envy that brought death into the world, as those who are
    his partners will discover. But the souls of the virtuous are in the hands
    of God, no torment shall ever touch them. In the eyes of the unwise, they
    did appear to die, their going looked like a disaster, their leaving us,
    like annihilation; but they are in peace. If they experienced punishment as
    men see it, their hope was rich with immortality; slight was their
    affliction, great will their blessings be. God has put them to the test and
    proved them worthy to be with him; he has tested them like gold in a
    furnace, and accepted them as a holocaust. When the time comes for his
    visitation they will shine out; as sparks run through the stubble, so will
    they. They shall judge nations, rule over peoples, and the Lord will be

    It is for you, then, to preach the behaviour which goes with healthy
    doctrine. The older men should be reserved, dignified, moderate, sound in
    faith and love and constancy. Similarly, the older women should behave as
    though they were religious, with no scandalmongering and no habitual
    wine-drinking - they are to be the teachers of the right behaviour and show
    the younger women how they should love their husbands and love their
    children, how they are to be sensible and chaste, and how to work in their
    homes, and be gentle, and do as their husbands tell them, so that the
    message of God is never disgraced. In the same way, you have got to persuade
    the younger men to be moderate and in everything you do make yourself an
    example to them of working for good: when you are teaching, be an example to
    them in your sincerity and earnestness and in keeping all that you say so
    wholesome that nobody can make objections to it; and then any opponent will
    be at a loss, with no accusation to make against us. You see, God's grace
    has been revealed, and it has made salvation possible for the whole human
    race and taught us that what we have to do is to give up everything that
    does not lead to God, and all our worldly ambitions; we must be
    self-restrained and live good and religious lives here in this present
    world, while we are waiting in hope for the blessing which will come with
    the Appearing of the glory of our great God and saviour Christ Jesus. He
    sacrificed himself for us in order to set us free from all wickedness and to
    purify a people so that it could be his very own and would have no ambition
    except to do good.

    Listen then, kings, and understand; rulers of remotest lands, take warning;
    hear this, you who have thousands under your rule, who boast of your hordes
    of subjects. For power is a gift to you from the Lord, sovereignty is from
    the Most High; he himself will probe your acts and scrutinise your
    intentions. If, as administrators of his kingdom, you have not governed
    justly nor observed the law, nor behaved as God would have you behave, he
    will fall on you swiftly and terribly. Ruthless judgment is reserved for the
    high and mighty; the lowly will be compassionately pardoned, the mighty will
    be mightily punished. For the Lord of All does not cower before a personage,
    he does not stand in awe of greatness, since he himself has made small and
    great and provides for all alike; but strict scrutiny awaits those in power.
    Yes, despots, my words are for you, that you may learn what wisdom is and
    not transgress; for they who observe holy things holily will be adjudged

    be courteous and always polite to all kinds of people. Remember, there was a

    On the way to Jerusalem Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and
    Galilee.&nbsp;As he entered one of the villages, ten lepers came to meet
    him. They stood some way off and called to him, 'Jesus! Master! Take pity on
    us.' &nbsp;When he saw them he said, 'Go and show yourselves to the
    priests'. Now as they were going away they were cleansed. Finding himself
    cured, one of them turned back praising God at the top of his voice and
    threw himself at the feet of Jesus and thanked him. The man was a Samaritan.
    This made Jesus say, 'Were not all ten made clean? The other nine, where are
    they? &nbsp;It seems that no one has come back to give praise to God, except
    this foreigner.' And he said to the man, 'Stand up and go on your way. Your
    faith has saved you.'

    Within wisdom is a spirit intelligent, holy, unique, manifold, subtle,
    active, incisive, unsullied, lucid, invulnerable, benevolent, sharp,
    irresistible, beneficent, loving to man, steadfast, dependable, unperturbed,
    almighty, all-surveying, penetrating all intelligent, pure and most subtle
    spirits; for Wisdom is quicker to move than any motion; she is so pure, she
    pervades and permeates all things. She is a breath of the power of God, pure
    emanation of the glory of the Almighty; hence nothing impure can find a way
    into her. She is a reflection of the eternal light, untarnished mirror of
    God's active power, image of his goodness. Although alone, she can do all;
    herself unchanging, she makes all things new. In each generation she passes
    into holy souls, she makes them friends of God and prophets; for God loves
    only the man who lives with Wisdom. She is indeed more splendid than the
    sun, she outshines all the constellations; compared with light, she takes
    first place, for light must yield to night, but over Wisdom evil can never
    triumph. She deploys her strength from one end of the earth to the other,
    ordering all things for good.

    I am so delighted, and comforted, to know of your love; they tell me,
    brother, how you have put new heart into the saints. Now, although in Christ
    I can have no diffidence about telling you to do whatever is your duty, I am
    appealing to your love instead, reminding you that this is Paul writing, an
    old man now and, what is more, still a prisoner of Christ Jesus. I am
    appealing to you for a child of mine, whose father I became while wearing
    these chains: I mean Onesimus. He was of no use to you before, but he will
    be useful to you now, as he has been to me. I am sending him back to you,
    and with him - I could say - a part of my own self. I should have liked to
    keep him with me; he could have been a substitute for you, to help me while
    I am in the chains that the Good News has brought me. However, I did not
    want to do anything without your consent; it would have been forcing your
    act of kindness, which should be spontaneous. I know you have been deprived
    of Onesimus for a time, but it was only so that you could have him back for
    ever, not as a slave any more, but something much better than a slave, a
    dear brother; especially dear to me, but how much more to you, as a
    blood-brother as well as a brother in the Lord. So if all that we have in
    common means anything to you, welcome him as you would me; but if he has
    wronged you in any way or owes you anything, then let me pay for it. I am
    writing this in my own handwriting: I, Paul, shall pay it back - I will not
    add any mention of your own debt to me, which is yourself. Well then,
    brother, I am counting on you, in the Lord; put new heart into me, in
    Christ.

    Asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was to come, Jesus gave them
    this answer, 'The coming of the kingdom of God does not admit of observation
    and there will be no one to say, "Look here! Look there!" For, you must
    know, the kingdom of God is among you.' He said to the disciples, 'A time
    will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man and
    will not see it. They will say to you, "Look there!" or, "Look here!" Make
    no move; do not set off in pursuit; for as the lightning flashing from one
    part of heaven lights up the other, so will be the Son of Man when his day
    comes. But first he must suffer grievously and be rejected by this
    generation.

    Naturally stupid are all men who have not known God and who, from the good
    things that are seen, have not been able to discover Him-who-is, or, by
    studying the works, have failed to recognise the Artificer. Fire however, or
    wind, or the swift air, the sphere of the stars, impetuous water, heaven's
    lamps, are what they have held to be the gods who govern the world. If,
    charmed by their beauty, they have taken things for gods, let them know how
    much the Lord of these excels them, since the very Author of beauty has
    created them. And if they have been impressed by their power and energy, let
    them deduce from these how much mightier is he that has formed them, since
    through the grandeur and beauty of the creatures we may, by analogy,
    contemplate their Author. Small blame, however, attaches to these men, for
    perhaps they only go astray in their search for God and their eagerness to
    find him; living among his works, they strive to comprehend them and fall
    victim to appearances, seeing so much beauty. Even so, they are not to be
    excused: if they are capable of acquiring enough knowledge to be able to
    investigate the world, how have they been so slow to find its Master?

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'As it was in Noah's day, so will it also be in
    the days of the Son of Man. People were eating and drinking, marrying wives
    and husbands, right up to the day Noah went into the ark, and the flood came
    and destroyed them all. It will be the same as it was in Lot's day: people
    were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building, but the
    day Lot left Sodom, God rained fire and brimstone from heaven and it
    destroyed them all. It will be the same when the day comes for the Son of
    Man to be revealed. 'When that day comes, anyone on the housetop, with his
    possessions in the house, must not come down to collect them, nor must
    anyone in the fields turn back either. Remember Lot 's wife. Anyone who
    tries to preserve his life will lose it; and anyone who loses it will keep
    it safe. I tell you, on that night two will be in one bed: one will be
    taken, the other left; two women will be grinding corn together: one will be
    taken, the other left.' The disciples interrupted. 'Where, Lord?' they
    asked. He said, 'Where the body is, there too will the vultures gather'.

    Jesus told his disciples a parable about the need to pray continually and
    never lose heart. &nbsp;'There was a judge in a certain town' he said 'who
    had neither fear of God nor respect for man. &nbsp;In the same town there
    was a widow who kept on coming to him and saying, "I want justice from you
    against my enemy!" &nbsp;For a long time he refused, but at last he said to
    himself, "Maybe I have neither fear of God nor respect for man, &nbsp;but
    since she keeps pestering me I must give this widow her just rights, or she
    will persist in coming and worry me to death".' &nbsp;And the Lord said 'You
    notice what the unjust judge has to say? &nbsp;Now will not God see justice
    done to his chosen who cry to him day and night even when he delays to help
    them? &nbsp;I promise you, he will see justice done to them, and done
    speedily. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find any faith on earth?'
