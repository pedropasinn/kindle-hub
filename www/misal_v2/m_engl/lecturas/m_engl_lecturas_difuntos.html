  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    Judas, the leader of the Jews, took a collection from the people
    individually, amounting to nearly two thousand drachmae, and sent it to
    Jerusalem to have a sacrifice for sin offered, an altogether fine and noble
    action, in which he took full account of the resurrection. For if he had not
    expected the fallen to rise again it would have been superfluous and foolish
    to pray for the dead, whereas if he had in view the splendid recompense
    reserved for those who make a pious end, the thought was holy and devout.
    This was why he had this atonement sacrifice offered for the dead, so that
    they might be released from their sin.

    The virtuous man, though he die before his time, will find rest. Length of
    days is not what makes age honourable, nor number of years the true measure
    of life; understanding, this is man's grey hairs, untarnished life, this is
    ripe old age. He has sought to please God, so God has loved him; as he was
    living among sinners, he has been taken up. He has been carried off so that
    evil may not warp his understanding or treachery seduce his soul; for the
    fascination of evil throws good things into the shade, and the whirlwind of
    desire corrupts a simple heart. Coming to perfection in so short a while, he
    achieved long life; his soul being pleasing to the Lord, he has taken him
    quickly from the wickedness around him. Yet people look on, uncomprehending;
    it does not enter their heads that grace and mercy await the chosen of the
    Lord, and protection, his holy ones.

    Hope is not deceptive, because the love of God has been poured into our
    hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given us. We were still helpless
    when at his appointed moment Christ died for sinful men. It is not easy to
    die even for a good man - though of course for someone really worthy, a man
    might be prepared to die - but what proves that God loves us is that Christ
    died for us while we were still sinners. Having died to make us righteous,
    is it likely that he would now fail to save us from God's anger? When we
    were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, we were still enemies; now
    that we have been reconciled, surely we may count on being saved by the life
    of his Son? Not merely because we have been reconciled but because we are
    filled with joyful trust in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom
    we have already gained our reconciliation.

    If it is certain that death reigned over everyone as the consequence of one

    condemnation on everyone, so the good act of one man brings everyone life
    and makes them justified. As by one man's disobedience many were made
    sinners, so by one man's obedience many will be made righteous. When law
    came, it was to multiply the opportunities of falling, but however great the
    number of sins committed, grace was even greater; and so, just as sin

    was not for any fault on the part of creation that it was made unable to
    attain its purpose, it was made so by God; but creation still retains the
    hope of being freed, like us, from its slavery to decadence, to enjoy the

    We know that he who raised the Lord Jesus to life will raise us with Jesus
    in our turn, and put us by his side and you with us. You see, all this is
    for your benefit, so that the more grace is multiplied among people, the
    more thanksgiving there will be, to the glory of God. That is why there is
    no weakening on our part, and instead, though this outer man of ours may be
    falling into decay, the inner man is renewed day by day. Yes the troubles
    which are soon over, though they weigh little, train us for the carrying of
    a weight of eternal glory which is out of all proportion to them. And so we
    have no eyes for things that are visible, but only for things that are
    invisible; for visible things last only for a time, and the invisible things
    are eternal. For we know that when the tent that we live in on earth is
    folded up, there is a house built by God for us, an everlasting home not
    made by human hands, in the heavens.

    alive until the Lord's coming will not have any advantage over those who
    have died. At the trumpet of God, the voice of the archangel will call out

    Five of them were foolish and five were sensible: the foolish ones did take
    their lamps, but they brought no oil, whereas the sensible ones took flasks
    of oil as well as their lamps. The bridegroom was late and they all grew
    drowsy and fell asleep. But at midnight there was a cry. "The bridegroom is
    here! Go out and meet him." At this, all those bridesmaids woke up and
    trimmed their lamps, and the foolish ones said to the sensible ones, "Give
    us some of your oil: our lamps are going out". But they replied, "There may
    not be enough for us and for you; you had better go to those who sell it and
    buy some for yourselves". They had gone off to buy it when the bridegroom
    arrived. Those who were ready went in with him to the wedding hall and the
    door was closed. The other bridesmaids arrived later. "Lord, Lord," they
    said, "open the door for us." But he replied, "I tell you solemnly, I do not

    one from another as the shepherd separates sheep from goats. He will place

    make you welcome; naked and clothe you; sick or in prison and go to see
    you?" And the King will answer, "I tell you solemnly, in so far as you did
    this to one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did it to me; Next
    he will say to those on his left hand, "Go away from me, with your curse
    upon you, to the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I
    was hungry and you never gave me food; I was thirsty and you never gave me
    anything to drink; I was a stranger and you never made me welcome, naked and

    Jesus went to a town called Nain, accompanied by his disciples and a great
    number of people. When he was near the gate of the town it happened that a
    dead man was being carried out for burial, the only son of his mother, and
    she was a widow. And a considerable number of the townspeople were with her.
    When the Lord saw her he felt sorry for her. `Do not cry,' he said. Then he
    went up and put his hand on the bier and the bearers stood still, and he
    said, `Young man, I tell you to get up'. And the dead man sat up and began
    to talk, and Jesus gave him to his mother. Everyone was filled with awe and
    praised God saying, `A great prophet has appeared among us; God has visited
    his people'. And this opinion of him spread throughout Judaea and all over
    the countryside.

    Jesus said to his disciples: `See that you are dressed for action and have
    your lamps lit. Be like men waiting for their master to return from the
    wedding feast, ready to open the door as soon as he comes and knocks. Happy
    those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. I tell you
    solemnly, he will put on an apron, sit them down at table and wait on them.
    It may be in the second watch he comes, or in the third, but happy those
    servants if he finds them ready. You may be quite sure of this, that if the
    householder had known at what hour the burglar would come, he would not have
    let anyone break through the wall of his house. You too must stand ready,
    because the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.'

    When the soldiers reached the place called The Skull, they crucified Jesus
    there and the two criminals also, one on the right, the other on the left.
    One of the criminals hanging there abused him. `Are you not the Christ?' he
    said. `Save yourself and us as well.' But the other spoke up and rebuked
    him. `Have you no fear of God at all?' he said. `You got the same sentence
    as he did, but in our case we deserved it: we are paying for what we did.
    But this man has done nothing wrong. Jesus,' he said, `remember me when you
    come into your kingdom.' `Indeed, I promise you,' he replied, `today you
    will be with me in paradise.'

    It was about the sixth hour and, with the sun eclipsed, a darkness came over
    the whole land until the ninth hour. The veil of the Temple was torn right
    down the middle; and when Jesus had cried out in a loud voice, he said,
    `Father, into your hands I commit my spirit'. With these words he breathed
    his last. Then a member of the council arrived, an upright and virtuous man
    named Joseph. This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. He
    then took it down, wrapped it in a shroud and put him in a tomb which was
    hewn in stone in which no one had yet been laid. On the first day of the
    week, at the first sign of dawn, the women went to the tomb with the spices
    they had prepared. They found that the stone had been rolled away from the
    tomb, but on entering discovered that the body of the Lord Jesus was not
    there. As they stood there not knowing what to think, two men in brilliant
    clothes suddenly appeared at their side. Terrified, the women lowered their
    eyes. But the two men said to them, `Why look among the dead for someone who
    is alive? He is not here; he has risen.'

    On the first day of the week, two of the disciples were on their way to a
    village called Emmaus, seven miles from Jerusalem, and they were talking
    together about all that had happened. Now as they talked this over, Jesus
    himself came up and walked by their side; but something prevented them from
    recognising him. He said to them, `What matters are you discussing as you
    walk along?' They stopped short, their faces downcast. Then one of them,
    called Cleopas, answered him, `You must be the only person staying in
    Jerusalem who does not know the things that have been happening there these
    last few days.' `What things?" he asked. `All about Jesus of Nazareth,' they
    answered, `who proved he was a great prophet by the things he said and did
    in the sight of God and of the whole people; and how our chief priests and
    our leaders handed him over to be sentenced to death, and had him crucified.
    Our own hope had been that he would be the one to set Israel free. And this
    is not all: two whole days have gone by since it all happened: and some
    women from our group have astounded us; they went to the tomb in the early
    morning, and when they did not find the body, they came back to tell us they
    had seen a vision of angels who declared he was alive. Some of our friends
    went to the tomb and found everything exactly as the women had reported, but
    of him they saw nothing.' Then he said to them, `You foolish men! So slow to
    believe the full message of the prophets! Was it not ordained that the
    Christ should suffer and so enter into his glory?' Then, starting with Moses
    and going through all the prophets, he explained to them the passages
    throughout the scriptures that were about himself. When they drew near to
    the village to which they were going, he made as if to go on; but they
    pressed him to stay with them. `It is nearly evening,' they said, `and the
    day is almost over.' So he went in to stay with them. Now while he was with
    them at table, he took the bread and said the blessing; then he broke it and
    handed it to them. And their eyes were opened and they recognised him; but
    he had vanished from their sight. Then they said to each other, `Did not our
    hearts burn within us as he talked to us on the road and explained the
    scriptures to us?' They set out that instant and returned to Jerusalem.
    There they found the Eleven assembled together with their companions, who
    said to them, `Yes, it is true. The Lord has risen and has appeared to
    Simon.' Then they told their story of what had happened on the road and how
    they had recognised him at the breaking of bread.

    brought to judgement he has passed from death to life. I tell you most

    On arriving at Bethany, Jesus found that Lazarus had been in the tomb for
    four days already. Bethany is only about two miles from Jerusalem, and many
    Jews had come to Martha and Mary to sympathise with them over their brother.
    When Martha heard that Jesus had come she went to meet him. Mary remained
    sitting in the house. Martha said to Jesus, `If you had been here, my
    brother would not have died, but I know that, even now, whatever you ask of
    God, he will grant you'. `Your brother,' said Jesus to her, `will rise
    again.' Martha said, `I know he will rise again at the resurrection on the
    last day'. Jesus said: `I am the resurrection and the life. If anyone
    believes in me, even though he dies he will live, and whoever lives and
    believes in me will never die. Do you believe this? 'Yes, Lord,' she said,

    Mary the sister of Lazarus went to Jesus, and as soon as she saw him she
    threw herself at his feet, saying, `Lord, if you had been here, my brother
    would not have died.' At the sight of her tears, and those of the Jews who
    followed her, Jesus said in great distress, with a sigh that came straight
    from the heart, `Where have you put him?' They said, `Lord, come and see'.
    Jesus wept; and the Jews said, `See how much he loved him!' But there were
    some who remarked, `He opened the eyes of the blind man, could he not have
    prevented this man's death?' Still sighing, Jesus reached the tomb: it was a
    cave with a stone to close the opening. Jesus said, `Take the stone away.'
    Martha said to him, `Lord, by now he will smell; this is the fourth day.'
    Jesus replied, `Have I not told you that if you believe you will see the
    glory of God?' So they took away the stone. Then Jesus lifted up his eyes
    and said: `Father, I thank you for hearing my prayer. I knew indeed that you
    always hear me, but I speak for the sake of all these who stand round me, so
    that they may believe it was you who sent me.' When he had said this, he
    cried in a loud voice, `Lazarus, here! Come out!' The dead man came out, his
    feet and hands bound with bands of stuff and a cloth round his face. Jesus
    said to them, `Unbind him, let him go free.' Many of the Jews who had come
    to visit Mary and had seen what he did believed in him.

    Jesus said to his disciples: `Do not let your hearts be troubled Trust in
    God still, and trust in me. There are many rooms in my Father's house; if
    there were not, I should have told you. I am going now to prepare a place
    for you, and after I have gone and prepared you a place, I shall return to
    take you with me; so that where I am you may be too. You know the way to the
    place where I am going.' Thomas said, `Lord, we do not know where you are
    going, so how can we know the way?' Jesus said: `I am the Way, the Truth and
    the Life. No one can come to the Father except through me.'

    Jesus raised his eyes to heaven and said: `Father, I want those you have
    given me to be with me where I am, so that they may always see the glory you
    have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world.
    Father, Righteous One, the world has not known you, but I have known you,
    and these have known that you have sent me. I have made your name known to
    them and will continue to make it known so that the love with which you
    loved me may be in them, and so that I may be in them.'

    Carrying his own cross, Jesus went out of the city to the place of the skull
    or, as it was called in Hebrew, Golgotha, where they crucified him with two
    others, one on either side with Jesus in the middle. Near the cross of Jesus
    stood his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary
    of Magdala. Seeing his mother and the disciple he loved standing near her,
    Jesus said to his mother, `Woman, this is your son'. Then to the disciple he
    said, `This is your mother'. After this, Jesus knew that everything had now
    been completed, and to fulfil the scripture perfectly he said: `I am
    thirsty'. A jar full of vinegar stood there, so putting a sponge soaked in
    the vinegar on a hyssop stick they held it up to his mouth. After Jesus had
    taken the vinegar he said, `It is accomplished'; and bowing his head he gave
    up his spirit. It was Preparation Day, and to prevent the bodies remaining
    on the cross during sabbath - since that sabbath was a day of special
    solemnity - the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies
    taken away. Consequently the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first
    man who had been crucified with him and then of the other. When they came to
    Jesus, they found he was already dead, and so instead of breaking his legs
    one of the soldiers pierced his side with a lance; and immediately there
    came out blood and water. This is the evidence of one who saw it -
    trustworthy evidence, and he knows he speaks the truth - and he gives it so
    that you may believe as well. Because all this happened to fulfil the words
    of scripture: Not one bone of his will be broken; and again, in another
    place scripture says: They will look on the one whom they have pierced.
    After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus - though a
    secret one because he was afraid of the Jews - asked Pilate to let him
    remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave permission, so they came and took it
    away. Nicodemus came as well - the same one who had first come to Jesus at
    night-time - and he brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a
    hundred pounds.
