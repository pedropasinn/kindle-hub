    Sharon; they shall see the glory of the Lord, the splendour of our God.
    Strengthen all weary hands, steady all trembling knees and say to all faint

    coming, the retribution of God; he is coming to save you.' Then the eyes of

    the Lord has ransomed shall return. They will come to Zion shouting for joy,

    sorrow and lament be ended.

    Be patient, brothers, until the Lord's coming. Think of a farmer: how

    John in his prison had heard what Christ was doing and he sent his disciples
    to ask him, 'Are you the one who is to come, or have we got to wait for
    someone else?' Jesus answered, 'Go back and tell John what you hear and see;
    the blind see again, and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf
    hear, and the dead are raised to life and the Good News is proclaimed to the
    poor; and happy is the man who does not lose faith in me'. As the messengers
    were leaving, Jesus began to talk to the people about John: 'What did you go
    out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the breeze? No? Then what
    did you go out to see? A man wearing fine clothes? Oh no, those who wear
    fine clothes are to be found in palaces. Then what did you go out for? To
    see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet: he is the one
    of whom scripture says: Look, I am going to send my messenger before you; he
    will prepare your way before you. 'I tell you solemnly, of all the children
    born of women, a greater than John the Baptist has never been seen; yet the
    least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he is.

    A man came, sent by God. His name was John. He came as a witness, as a
    witness to speak for the light, so that everyone might believe through him.
    He was not the light, only a witness to speak for the light. This is how
    John appeared as a witness. When the Jews sent priests and Levites from
    Jerusalem to ask him, 'Who are you?' he not only declared, but he declared
    quite openly, 'I am not the Christ'. 'Well then,' they asked 'are you
    Elijah?' 'I am not' he said. 'Are you the Prophet?' He answered, 'No'. So
    they said to him, 'Who are you? We must take back an answer to those who
    sent us. What have you to say about yourself?' So John said, 'I am, as
    Isaiah prophesied: a voice that cries in the wilderness: Make a straight way
    for the Lord'. Now these men had been sent by the Pharisees, and they put
    this further question to him, 'Why are you baptising if you are not the
    Christ, and not Elijah, and not the prophet?' John replied, 'I baptise with
    water; but there stands among you - unknown to you - the one who is coming
    after me; and I am not fit to undo his sandal-strap'. This happened at
    Bethany, on the far side of the Jordan, where John was baptising.

    When all the people asked John, 'What must we do, then?' he answered, 'If
    anyone has two tunics he must share with the man who has none, and the one
    with something to eat must do the same'. There were tax collectors too who
    came for baptism, and these said to him, 'Master, what must we do?' He said
    to them, 'Exact no more than your rate'. Some soldiers asked him in their
    turn, 'What about us? What must we do?' He said to them, 'No intimidation!
    No extortion! Be content with your pay!' A feeling of expectancy had grown
    among the people, who were beginning to think that John might be the Christ,
    so John declared before them all, 'I baptise you with water, but someone is
    coming, someone who is more powerful than I am, and I am not fit to undo the
    strap of his sandals; he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His
    winnowing-fan is in his hand to clear his threshing-floor and to gather the
    wheat into his barn; but the chaff he will burn in a fire that will never go
    out.' As well as this, there were many other things he said to exhort the
    people and to announce the Good News to them.

    Jesus had gone into the Temple and was teaching, when the chief priests and
    the elders of the people came to him and said, 'What authority have you for
    acting like this? And who gave you this authority?' 'And I' replied Jesus
    'will ask you a question, only one; if you tell me the answer to it, I will
    then tell you my authority for acting like this. John's baptism: where did
    it come from: heaven or man?' And they argued it out this way among

    serve him under the same yoke. From beyond the banks of the rivers of
    Ethiopia my suppliants will bring me offerings. When that day comes you need
    feel no shame for all the misdeeds you have committed against me, for I will
    remove your proud boasters from your midst; and you will cease to strut on
    my holy mountain. In your midst I will leave a humble and lowly people, and
    those who are left in Israel will seek refuge in the name of the Lord. They
    will do no wrong, will tell no lies; and the perjured tongue will no longer
    be found in their mouths. But they will be able to graze and rest with no
    one to disturb them.

    Jesus said to the chief priests and the elders of the people: 'What is your
    opinion? A man had two sons. He went and said to the first, "My boy, you go
    and work in the vineyard today". &nbsp;He answered, "I will not go", but
    afterwards thought better of it and went. &nbsp;The man then went and said
    the same thing to the second who answered, "Certainly, sir", but did not go.
    &nbsp;Which of the two did the father's will?' 'The first' they said. Jesus
    said to them, 'I tell you solemnly, tax collectors and prostitutes are
    making their way into the kingdom of God before you. &nbsp;For John came to
    you, a pattern of true righteousness, but you did not believe him, and yet

    John, summoning two of his disciples, sent them to the Lord to ask, 'Are you
    the one who is to come, or must we wait for someone else?' When the men
    reached Jesus they said, 'John the Baptist has sent us to you, to ask, "Are
    you the one who is to come or have we to wait for someone else?"' lt was
    just then that he cured many people of diseases and afflictions and of evil
    spirits, and gave the gift of sight to many who were blind. Then he gave the
    messengers their answer, 'Go back and tell John what you have seen and
    heard: the blind see again, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf
    hear, the dead are raised to life, the Good News is proclaimed to the poor

    Shout for joy, you barren women who bore no children! Break into cries of
    joy and gladness, you who were never in labour! For the sons of the forsaken
    one are more in number than the sons of the wedded wife, says the Lord.
    Widen the space of your tent, stretch out your hangings freely, lengthen
    your ropes, make your pegs firm; for you will burst out to right and to
    left. Your race will take possession of the nations, and people the
    abandoned cities. Do not be afraid, you will not be put to shame, do not be

    will be 'the Holy One of Israel, he is called the God of the whole earth.
    Yes, like a forsaken wife, distressed in spirit, the Lord calls you back.
    Does a man cast off the wife of his youth? says your God. I did forsake you
    for a brief moment, but with great love will I take you back. In excess of
    anger, for a moment I hid my face from you. But with everlasting love I have
    taken pity on you, says the Lord, your redeemer. I am now as I was in the
    days of Noah when I swore that Noah's waters should never flood the world
    again. So now I swear concerning my anger with you and the threats I made
    against you; for the mountains may depart, the hills be shaken, but my love
    for you will never leave you and my covenant of peace with you will never be
    shaken, says the Lord who takes pity on you.

    When John's messengers had gone Jesus began to talk to the people about
    John, 'What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the
    breeze? No? Then what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes?
    Oh no, those who go in for fine clothes and live luxuriously are to be found
    at court! Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and
    much more than a prophet: he is the one of whom scripture says: See, I am
    going to send my messenger before you; he will prepare the way before you.
    'I tell you, of all the children born of women, there is no one greater than
    John; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he is'. All the
    people who heard him, and the tax collectors too, acknowledged God's plan by
    accepting baptism from John; but by refusing baptism from him the Pharisees
    and the lawyers had thwarted what God had in mind for them.
