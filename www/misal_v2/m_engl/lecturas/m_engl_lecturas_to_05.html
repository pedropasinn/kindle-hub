    Thus says the Lord: Share your bread with the hungry, and shelter the

    own kin? Then will your light shine like the dawn and your wound be quickly
    healed over. Your integrity will go before you and the glory of the Lord
    behind you. Cry, and the Lord will answer; call, and he will say, 'I am
    here'. If you do away with the yoke, the clenched fist, the wicked word, if
    you give your bread to the hungry, and relief to the oppressed, your light
    will rise in the darkness, and your shadows become like noon.

    When I came to you, brothers, it was not with any show of oratory or
    philosophy, but simply to tell you what God had guaranteed. During my stay
    with you, the only knowledge I claimed to have was about Jesus, and only
    about him as the crucified Christ. Far from relying on any power of my own,
    I came among you in great 'fear and trembling' and in my speeches and the
    sermons that I gave, there were none of the arguments that belong to
    philosophy; only a demonstration of the power of the Spirit. And I did this
    so that your faith should not depend on human philosophy but on the power of
    God.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'You are the salt of the earth. But if salt

    can only be thrown out to be trampled underfoot by men. 'You are the light
    of the world. A city built on a hill-top cannot be hidden. No one lights a

    I do not boast of preaching the gospel, since it is a duty which has been
    laid on me; I should be punished if I did not preach it! If I had chosen
    this work myself, I might have been paid for it, but as I have not, it is a
    responsibility which has been put into my hands. Do you know what my reward
    is? It is this in my preaching, to be able to offer the Good News free, and
    not insist on the rights which the gospel gives me. So though I am not a
    slave of any man I have made myself the slave of everyone so as to win as
    many as I could. For the weak I made myself weak. I made myself all things
    to all men in order to save some at any cost; and I still do this, for the
    sake of the gospel, to have a share in its blessings.

    On leaving the synagogue, Jesus went with James and John straight to the
    house of Simon and Andrew. Now Simon's mother-in-law had gone to bed with
    fever, and they told him about her straightaway. He went to her, took her by
    the hand and helped her up. And the fever left her and she began to wait on
    them. That evening, after sunset, they brought to him all who were sick and
    those who were possessed by devils. The whole town came crowding round the
    door, and he cured many who were suffering from diseases of one kind or
    another; he also cast out many devils, but he would not allow them to speak,
    because they knew who he was. In the morning, long before dawn, he got up
    and left the house, and went off to a lonely place and prayed there. Simon
    and his companions set out in search of him, and when they found him they
    said, 'Everybody is looking for you'. He answered, 'Let us go elsewhere, to
    the neighbouring country towns, so that I can preach there too, because that
    is why I came'. And he went all through Galilee, preaching in their
    synagogues and casting out devils.

    In the year of King Uzziah's death I saw the Lord seated on a high throne;
    his train filled the sanctuary; above him stood seraphs, each one with six
    wings. And they cried out one to another in this way, 'Holy, holy, holy is
    the Lord of hosts. His glory fills the whole earth.' The foundations of the
    threshold shook with the voice of the one who cried out and the Temple was
    filled with smoke. I said: 'What a wretched state I am in! I am lost, for I
    am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my
    eyes have looked at the King, the Lord of hosts.' Then one of the seraphs
    flew to me, holding in his hand a live coal which he had taken from the
    altar with a pair of tongs. With this he touched my mouth and said: 'See
    now, this has touched your lips, your sin is taken away, your iniquity is
    purged'. Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying: 'Whom shall I send? Who
    will be our messenger?' I answered, 'Here I am, send me'.

    Brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, the gospel
    that you received and in which you are firmly established; because the
    gospel will save you only if you keep believing exactly what I preached to
    you - believing anything else will not lead to anything. Well then, in the

    died for our sins, in accordance with the scriptures; that he was buried;
    and that he was raised to life on the third day, in accordance with the
    scriptures; that he appeared first to Cephas and secondly to the Twelve.
    Next he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time,
    most of whom are still alive, though some have died; then he appeared to
    James, and then to all the apostles; and last of all he appeared to me too;
    it was as though I was born when no one expected it. I am the least of the
    apostles; in fact, since I persecuted the Church of God, I hardly deserve
    the name apostle; but by God's grace that is what I am, and the grace that
    he gave me has not been fruitless. On the contrary, I, or rather the grace

    Jesus was standing one day by the Lake of Gennesaret, with the crowd
    pressing round him listening to the word of God, when he caught sight of two
    boats close to the bank. The fishermen had gone out of them and were washing
    their nets. &nbsp;He got into one of the boats -it was Simon's- and asked
    him to put out a little from the shore. Then he sat down and taught the
    crowds from the boat. When he had finished speaking he said to Simon, 'Put
    out into deep water and pay out your nets for a catch'. 'Master,' Simon
    replied 'we worked hard all night long and caught nothing, but if you say
    so, I will pay out the nets.' And when they had done this they netted such a
    huge number of fish that their nets began to tear, so they signalled to
    their companions in the other boat to come and help them; when these came,
    they filled the two boats to sinking point. When Simon Peter saw this he
    fell at the knees of Jesus saying, 'Leave me, Lord; I am a sinful man'. For
    he and all his companions were completely overcome by the catch they had
    made; so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were Simon's
    partners. But Jesus said to Simon, 'Do not be afraid; from now on it is men
    you will catch'. Then, bringing their boats back to land, they left
    everything and followed him.

    In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was a
    formless void, there was darkness over the deep, and God's spirit hovered
    over the water. God said, 'Let there be light', and there was light. God saw
    that light was good, and God divided light from darkness. God called light
    'day', and darkness he called 'night'. Evening came and morning came: the
    first day. God said, 'Let there be a vault in the waters to divide the
    waters in two'. And so it was. God made the vault, and it divided the waters
    above the vault from the waters under the vault. God called the vault
    'heaven'. Evening came and morning came: the second day. God said, 'Let the
    waters under heaven come together into a single mass, and let dry land
    appear'. And so it was. God called the dry land 'earth' and the mass of
    waters 'seas', and God saw that it was good. God said, 'Let the earth
    produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants, and fruit trees bearing fruit with
    their seed inside, on the earth'. And so it was. The earth produced
    vegetation: plants bearing seed in their several kinds, and trees bearing
    fruit with their seed inside in their several kinds. God saw that it was
    good. Evening came and morning came: the third day. God said, 'Let there be
    lights in the vault of heaven to divide day from night, and let them
    indicate festivals, days and years. Let them be lights in the vault of
    heaven to shine on the earth.' And so it was. God made the two great lights:
    the greater light to govern the day, the smaller light to govern the night,
    and the God set them in the vault of heaven to shine on the earth, to govern
    the day and the night and to divide light from darkness. God saw that it was
    good. Evening came and morning came: the fourth day.

    Solomon called the elders of Israel together in Jerusalem to bring the ark
    of the covenant of the Lord up from the Citadel of David, which is Zion. All
    the men of Israel assembled round King Solomon in the month of Ethanim, at
    the time of the feast (that is, the seventh month), and the priests took up
    the ark and the Tent of Meeting with all the sacred vessels that were in it.
    In the presence of the ark, King Solomon and all Israel sacrificed sheep and
    oxen, countless, innumerable. The priests brought the ark of the covenant of
    the Lord to its place, in the Debir of the Temple, that is, in the Holy of
    Holies, under the cherubs' wings. For there where the ark was placed the
    cherubs spread out their wings and sheltered the ark and its shafts. There
    was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets Moses had placed in it
    at Horeb, the tablets of the covenant which the Lord had made with the
    Israelites when they came out of the land of Egypt; they are still there
    today. Now when the priests came out of the sanctuary, the cloud filled the
    Temple of the Lord, and because of the cloud the priests could no longer
    perform their duties: the glory of the Lord filled the Lord's Temple. Then
    Solomon said: 'The Lord has chosen to dwell in the thick cloud. Yes, I have
    built you a dwelling, a place for you to live in for ever.'

    Having made the crossing, Jesus and his disciples came to land at Gennesaret
    and tied up. No sooner had they stepped out of the boat than people
    recognised him, and started hurrying all through the countryside and brought
    the sick on stretchers to wherever they heard he was. And wherever he went,
    to village, or town, or farm, they laid down the sick in the open spaces,
    begging him to let them touch even the fringe of his cloak. And all those
    who touched him were cured.

    God said, 'Let the waters teem with living creatures, and let birds fly
    above the earth within the vault of heaven'. And so it was. God created
    great sea-serpents and every kind of living creature with which the waters
    teem, and every kind of winged creature. God saw that it was good. God
    blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the waters of the
    seas; and let the birds multiply upon the earth'. Evening came and morning
    came: the fifth day. God said, 'Let the earth produce every kind of living
    creature: cattle, reptiles, and every kind of wild beast'. And so it was.
    God made every kind of wild beast, every kind of cattle, and every kind of
    land reptile. God saw that it was good. God said, 'Let us make man in our
    own image, in the likeness of ourselves, and let them be masters of the fish
    of the sea, the birds of heaven, the cattle, all the wild beasts and all the
    reptiles that crawl upon the earth'. God created man in the image of
    himself, in the image of God he created him, male and female he created
    them. God blessed them, saying to them, 'Be fruitful, multiply, fill the
    earth and conquer it. Be masters of the fish of the sea, the birds of heaven
    and all living animals on the earth.' God said, 'See, I give you all the
    seed-bearing plants that are upon the whole earth, and all the trees with
    seed-bearing fruit; this shall be your food. To all wild beasts, all birds
    of heaven and all living reptiles on the earth I give all the foliage of
    plants for food.' And so it was. God saw all he had made, and indeed it was
    very good. Evening came and morning came: the sixth day. Thus heaven and
    earth were completed with all their array. On the seventh day God completed
    the work he had been doing. He rested on the seventh day after all the work
    he had been doing. God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on
    that day he had rested after all his work of creating. Such were the origins
    of heaven and earth when they were created.

    The Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered
    round Jesus, and they noticed that some of his disciples were eating with
    unclean hands, that is, without washing them. For the Pharisees, and the
    Jews in general, follow the tradition of the elders and never eat without
    washing their arms as far as the elbow; and on returning from the market
    place they never eat without first sprinkling themselves. There are also
    many other observances which have been handed down to them concerning the
    washing of cups and pots and bronze dishes. So these Pharisees and scribes
    asked him, 'Why do your disciples not respect the tradition of the elders
    but eat their food with unclean hands?' He answered, 'It was of you
    hypocrites that Isaiah so rightly prophesied in this passage of scripture:
    This people honours me only with lip-service, while their hearts are far
    from me. The worship they offer me is worthless, the doctrines they teach
    are only human regulations. You put aside the commandment of God to cling to
    human traditions.' And he said to them, 'How ingeniously you get round the
    commandment of God in order to preserve your own tradition! For Moses said:
    Do your duty to your father and your mother, and, Anyone who curses father
    or mother must be put to death. But you say, "If a man says to his father or
    mother: Anything I have that I might have used to help you is Corban (that
    is, dedicated to God), then he is forbidden from that moment to do anything
    for his father or mother". In this way you make God's word null and void for
    the sake of your tradition which you have handed down. And you do many other
    things like this.'

    At the time when the Lord God made earth and heaven there was as yet no wild
    bush on the earth nor had any wild plant yet sprung up, for the Lord God had
    not sent rain on the earth, nor was there any man to till the soil. However,
    a flood was rising from the earth and watering all the surface of the soil.
    The Lord God fashioned man of dust from the soil. Then he breathed into his
    nostrils a breath of life, and thus man became a living being. The Lord God
    planted a garden in Eden which is in the east, and there he put the man he
    had fashioned. The Lord God caused to spring up from the soil every kind of
    tree, enticing to look at and good to eat, with the tree of life and the
    tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the middle of the garden. The Lord
    God took the man and settled him in the garden of Eden to cultivate and take
    care of it. Then the Lord God gave the man this admonition, 'You may eat
    indeed of all the trees in the garden. Nevertheless of the tree of the
    knowledge of good and evil you are not to eat, for on the day you eat of it
    you shall most surely die.'

    The fame of Solomon having reached the queen of Sheba, she came to test him
    with difficult questions. She brought immense riches to Jerusalem with her,
    camels laden with spices, great quantities of gold, and precious stones. On
    coming to Solomon, she opened her mind freely to him; and Solomon had an
    answer for all her questions, not one of them was too obscure for the king
    to expound. When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, the
    palace he had built, the food at his table, the accommodation for his
    officials, the organisation of his staff and the way they were dressed, his
    cup-bearers, and the holocausts he offered in the Temple of the Lord, it
    left her breathless, and she said to the king, 'What I heard in my own
    country about you and your wisdom was true, then! Until I came and saw it
    with my own eyes I could not believe what they told me, but clearly they
    told me less than half: for wisdom and prosperity you surpass the report I
    heard. How happy your wives are! How happy are these servants of yours who
    wait on you always and hear your wisdom! Blessed be the Lord your God who
    has granted you his favour, setting you on the throne of Israel! Because of
    the Lord's everlasting love for Israel, he has made you king to deal out law
    and justice.' And she presented the king with a hundred and twenty talents
    of gold and great quantities of spices and precious stones; no such wealth
    of spices ever came again as those given to King Solomon by the queen of
    Sheba.

    Jesus called the people to him again and said, 'Listen to me, all of you,
    and understand. Nothing that goes into a man from outside can make him
    unclean; it is the things that come out of a man that make him unclean. If
    anyone has ears to hear, let him listen to this.' When he had gone back into
    the house, away from the crowd, his disciples questioned him about the
    parable. He said to them, 'Do you not understand either? Can you not see
    that whatever goes into a man from outside cannot make him unclean, because
    it does not go into his heart but through his stomach and passes out into
    the sewer?' (Thus he pronounced all foods clean.) And he went on, 'It is
    what comes out of a man that makes him unclean. For it is from within, from
    men's hearts, that evil intentions emerge: fornication, theft, murder,
    adultery, avarice, malice, deceit, indecency, envy, slander, pride, folly.
    All these evil things come from within and make a man unclean.'

    The Lord God said, 'It is not good that the man should be alone. I will make
    him a helpmate.' So from the soil the Lord God fashioned all the wild beasts
    and all the birds of heaven. These he brought to the man to see what he
    would call them; each one was to bear the name the man would give it. The
    man gave names to all the cattle, all the birds of heaven and all the wild
    beasts. But no helpmate suitable for man was found for him. So the Lord God
    made the man fall into a deep sleep. And while he slept, he took one of his
    ribs and enclosed it in flesh. The Lord God built the rib he had taken from
    the man into a woman, and brought her to the man. The man exclaimed: 'This
    at last is bone from my bones, and flesh from my flesh! This is to be called
    woman, for this was taken from man.' This is why a man leaves his father and
    mother and joins himself to his wife, and they become one body. Now both of
    them were naked, the man and his wife, but they felt no shame in front of
    each other.

    When Solomon grew old his wives swayed his heart to other gods; and his
    heart was not wholly with the Lord his God as his father David's had been.
    Solomon became a follower of Astarte, the goddess of the Sidonians, and of
    Milcom, the Ammonite abomination. He did what was displeasing to the Lord,
    and was not a wholehearted follower of the Lord, as his father David had
    been. Then it was that Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the god of
    Moab on the mountain to the east of Jerusalem, and to Milcom the god of the
    Ammonites. He did the same for all his foreign wives, who offered incense
    and sacrifice to their gods. The Lord was angry with Solomon because his
    heart had turned from the Lord the God of Israel who had twice appeared to
    him and who had then forbidden him to follow other gods; but he did not
    carry out the Lord's order. The Lord therefore said to Solomon, 'Since you
    behave like this and do not keep my covenant or the laws I laid down for
    you, I will most surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of
    your servants.' For your father David's sake, however, I will not do this
    during your lifetime, but will tear it out of your son's hands. Even so, I
    will not tear the whole kingdom from him. For the sake of my servant David,
    and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen, I will leave your son one
    tribe.'

    Jesus left Gennesaret and set out for the territory of Tyre. There he went
    into a house and did not want anyone to know he was there, but he could not
    pass unrecognised. A woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard
    about him straightaway and came and fell at his feet. Now the woman was a
    pagan, by birth a Syrophoenician, and she begged him to cast the devil out
    of her daughter. And he said to her, 'The children should be fed first,
    because it is not fair to take the children's food and throw it to the
    house-dogs'. But she spoke up: 'Ah yes, sir,' she replied 'but the
    house-dogs under the table can eat the children's scraps'. And he said to
    her, 'For saying this, you may go home happy: the devil has gone out of your
    daughter'. So she went off to her home and found the child lying on the bed
    and the devil gone.

    The serpent was the most subtle of all the wild beasts that the Lord God had
    made. It asked the woman, 'Did God really say you were not to eat from any
    of&nbsp; the trees in the garden?' The woman answered the serpent, 'We may
    eat the fruit of the trees in the garden. But of the fruit of the tree in
    the middle of the garden God said, "You must not eat it, nor touch it, under
    pain of death".' Then the serpent said to the woman, 'No! You will not die!
    God knows in fact that on the day you eat it your eyes will be opened and
    you will be like gods, knowing good and evil.' The woman saw that the tree
    was good to eat and pleasing to the eye, and that it was desirable for the
    knowledge that it could give. So she took some of its fruit and ate it. She
    gave some also to her husband who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes
    of both of them were opened and they realised that they were naked. So they
    sewed fig-leaves together to make themselves loin-cloths. The man and his
    wife heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of
    the day, and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden.

    Returning from the district of Tyre, Jesus went by way of Sidon towards the
    Sea of Galilee, right through the Decapolis region. &nbsp;And they brought
    him a deaf man who had an impediment in his speech; and they asked him to
    lay his hand on him. &nbsp;He took him aside in private, away from the
    crowd, put his fingers into the man's ears and touched his tongue with
    spittle.&nbsp;Then looking up to heaven he sighed; and he said to him,
    'Ephphatha', that is, 'Be opened'. &nbsp;And his ears were opened, and the
    ligament of his tongue was loosened and he spoke clearly. &nbsp;And Jesus
    ordered them to tell no one about it, but the more he insisted, the more

    The Lord God called to the man. 'Where are you?' he asked. 'I heard the
    sound of you in the garden;' he replied 'I was afraid because I was naked,
    so I hid.' 'Who told you that you were naked?' he asked 'Have you been
    eating of the tree I forbade you to eat?' The man replied, 'It was the woman
    you put with me; she gave me the fruit, and I ate it'. Then the Lord God
    asked the woman, 'What is this you have done?' The woman replied, 'The
    serpent tempted me and I ate'. Then the Lord God said to the serpent,
    'Because you have done this, Be accursed beyond all cattle, all wild beasts.
    You shall crawl on your belly and eat dust every day of your life. I will
    make you enemies of each other: you and the woman, your offspring and her
    offspring. It will crush your head and you will strike its heel'. To the
    woman he said: 'I will multiply your pains in childbearing, you shall give
    birth to your children in pain. Your yearning shall be for your husband, yet
    he will lord it over you.' To the man he said, 'Because you listened to the
    voice of your wife and ate from the tree of which I had forbidden you to
    eat, Accursed be the soil because of you. With suffering shall you get your
    food from it every day of your life. It shall yield you brambles and
    thistles, and you shall eat wild plants. With sweat on your brow shall you
    eat your bread, until you return to the soil, as you were taken from it. For
    dust you are and to dust you shall return.' The man named his wife 'Eve'
    because she was the mother of all those who live. The Lord God made clothes
    out of&nbsp;skins for the man and his wife, and they put them on. Then the
    Lord God said, 'See, the man has become like one of us, with his knowledge
    of good and evil. He must not be allowed to stretch his hand out next and
    pick from the tree of life also, and eat some and live for ever.' So the
    Lord God expelled him from the garden of Eden, to till the soil from which
    he had been taken. He banished the man, and in front of the garden of Eden
    he posted the cherubs, and the flame of a flashing sword, to guard the way
    to the tree of life.

    Jeroboam thought to himself, 'As things are, the kingdom will revert to the
    House of David. If this people continues to go up to the Temple of the Lord
    in Jerusalem to offer sacrifices, the people's heart will turn back again to
    their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah, and they will put me to death.' So the
    king thought this over and then made two golden calves; he said to the
    people, 'You have been going up to Jerusalem long enough. Here are your
    gods, Israel; these brought you up out of the land of Egypt!' He set up one
    in Bethel and the people went in procession all the way to Dan in front of
    the other. He set up the temple of the high places and appointed priests
    from ordinary families, who were not of the sons of Levi. Jeroboam also
    instituted a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth of the month, like
    the feast that was kept in Judah, and he went up to the altar. That was how
    he behaved in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves he had made; and at Bethel
    he put the priests of the high places he had established. Jeroboam did not
    give up his wicked ways after this incident, but went on appointing priests
    for the high places from the common people. He consecrated as priests of the
    high places any who wished to be. Such conduct made the House of Jeroboam a
    sinful House, and caused its ruin and extinction from the face of the earth.

    A great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat. So Jesus called his
    disciples to him and said to them, 'I feel sorry for all these people; they
    have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. If I send them
    off home hungry they will collapse on the way; some have come a great
    distance.' His disciples replied, 'Where could anyone get bread to feed
    these people in a deserted place like this?' He asked them, 'How many loaves
    have you?' 'Seven' they said. Then he instructed the crowd to sit down on
    the ground, and he took the seven loaves, and after giving thanks he broke
    them and handed them to his disciples to distribute; and they distributed
    them among the crowd. They had a few small fish as well, and over these he
    said a blessing and ordered them to be distributed also. They ate as much as
    they wanted, and they collected seven basketfuls of the scraps left over.
    Now there had been about four thousand people. He sent them away and
    immediately, getting into the boat with his disciples, went to the region of
    Dalmanutha.
