    Seeing Jesus coming towards him, John said, 'Look, there is the lamb of God
    that takes away the sin of the world. &nbsp;This is the one I spoke of when
    I said: A man is coming after me who ranks before me because he existed
    before me. I did not know him myself, and yet it was to reveal him to Israel
    that I came baptising with water.' John also declared, 'I saw the Spirit
    coming down on him from heaven like a dove and resting on him. I did not
    know him myself, but he who sent me to baptise with water had said to me,
    "The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and rest is the one who is
    going to baptise with the Holy Spirit". &nbsp;Yes, I have seen and I am the
    witness that he is the Chosen One of God.'

    Samuel was lying in the sanctuary of the Lord where the ark of God was, when
    the Lord called, 'Samuel! Samuel!' He answered, 'Here I am'. Then he ran to
    Eli and said, 'Here I am, since you called me'. Eli said, 'I did not call.
    Go back and lie down.' So he went and lay down. Once again the Lord called,
    'Samuel! Samuel!' Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, 'Here I am, since
    you called me'. He replied, 'I did not call you, my son; go back and lie
    down'. Samuel had as yet no knowledge of the Lord and the word of the Lord
    had not yet been revealed to him. Once again the Lord called, the third
    time. He got up and went to Eli and said, 'Here I am, since you called me'.
    Eli then understood that it was the Lord who was calling the boy, and he
    said to Samuel, 'Go and lie down, and if someone calls say, "Speak, Lord,
    your servant is listening"'. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. The
    Lord then came and stood by, calling as he had done before, 'Samuel!
    Samuel!' Samuel answered, 'Speak, Lord, your servant is listening'. Samuel
    grew up and the Lord was with him and let no word of his fall to the ground.

    The body is not meant for fornication; it is for the Lord, and the Lord for
    the body. God, who raised the Lord from the dead, will by his power raise us
    up too. You know, surely, that your bodies are members making up the body of
    Christ; anyone who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with him. Keep away
    from fornication. All the other sins are committed outside the body; but to
    fornicate is to sin against your own body. Your body, you know, is the
    temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you since you received him from God.
    You are not your own property; you have been bought and paid for. That is
    why you should use your body for the glory of God.

    As John stood there with two of his disciples, Jesus passed, and John stared
    hard at him and said, 'Look, there is the lamb of God'. Hearing this, the
    two disciples followed Jesus. Jesus turned round, saw them following and
    said, 'What do you want?' They answered, 'Rabbi,' - which means Teacher
    -'where do you live?' 'Come and see' he replied; so they went and saw where
    he lived, and stayed with him the rest of that day. It was about the tenth
    hour. One of these two who became followers of Jesus after hearing what John
    had said was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter. Early next morning, Andrew
    met his brother and said to him, 'We have found the Messiah' - which means
    the Christ - and he took Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked hard at him and said,
    'You are Simon son of John; you are to be called Cephas' - meaning Rock.

    There was a wedding at Cana in Galilee. The mother of Jesus was there, and
    Jesus and his disciples had also been invited. When they ran out of wine,
    since the wine provided for the wedding was all finished, the mother of
    Jesus said to him, 'They have no wine'. Jesus said 'Woman, why turn to me?
    My hour has not come yet.' His mother said to the servants, 'Do whatever he
    tells you'. There were six stone water jars standing there, meant for the
    ablutions that are customary among the Jews: each could hold twenty or
    thirty gallons. Jesus said to the servants, 'Fill the jars with water', and
    they filled them to the brim. 'Draw some out now' he told them 'and take it
    to the steward.' They did this; the steward tasted the water, and it had
    turned into wine. Having no idea where it came from - only the servants who
    had drawn the water knew - the steward called the bridegroom and said;
    'People generally serve the best wine first, and keep the cheaper sort till
    the guests have had plenty to drink; but you have kept the best wine till
    now'. This was the first of the signs given by Jesus: it was given at Cana
    in Galilee. He let his glory be seen, and his disciples believed in him.

    Every high priest has been taken out of mankind and is appointed to act for
    men in their relations with God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins; and
    so he can sympathise with those who are ignorant or uncertain because he too
    lives in the limitations of weakness. That is why he has to make sin
    offerings for himself as well as for the people. No one takes this honour on
    himself, but each one is called by God, as Aaron was. Nor did Christ give
    himself the glory of becoming high priest, but he had it from the one who
    said to him: You are my son, today I have become your father, and in another
    text: You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek, and for ever. During his
    life on earth, he offered up prayer and entreaty, aloud and in silent tears,
    to the one who had the power to save him out of death, and he submitted so
    humbly that his prayer was heard. Although he was Son, he learnt to obey
    through suffering; but having been made perfect, he became for all who obey
    him the source of eternal salvation and was acclaimed by God with the title
    of high priest of the order of Melchizedek.

    Samuel said to Saul, 'Stop! Let me tell you what the Lord said to me last
    night.' Saul said, 'Tell me'. Samuel continued, 'Small as you may be in your
    own eyes, are you not head of the tribes of Israel? The Lord has anointed
    you king over Israel. The Lord sent you on a mission and said to you, "Go,
    put these sinners, the Amalekites, under the ban and make war on them until
    they are exterminated". Why then did you not obey the voice of the Lord? Why
    did you fall on the booty and do what is displeasing to the Lord?' Saul
    replied to Samuel, 'But I did obey the voice of the Lord. I went on the
    mission which the Lord gave me; I brought back Agag king of the Amalekites;
    I put the Amalekites under the ban. From the booty the people took the best
    sheep and oxen of what was under the ban to sacrifice them to the Lord your
    God in Gilgal.' But Samuel replied: 'Is the pleasure of the Lord in
    holocausts and sacrifices or in obedience to the voice of the Lord? Yes,
    obedience is better than sacrifice, submissiveness better than the fat of
    rams. Rebellion is a sin of sorcery, presumption a crime of teraphim. 'Since
    you have rejected the word of the Lord, he has rejected you as king.'

    One day when John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, some people
    came and said to him, 'Why is it that John's disciples and the disciples of
    the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?' Jesus replied, 'Surely the
    bridegroom's attendants would never think of fasting while the bridegroom is
    still with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they could
    not think of fasting. But the time will come for the bridegroom to be taken
    away from them, and then, on that day, they will fast. No one sews a piece
    of unshrunken cloth on an old cloak; if he does, the patch pulls away from
    it, the new from the old, and the tear gets worse. And nobody puts new wine
    into old wineskins; if he does, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine
    is lost and the skins too. No! New wine, fresh skins!'

    God would not be so unjust as to forget all you have done, the love that you
    have for his name or the services you have done, and are still doing, for
    the saints. Our one desire is that every one of you should go on showing the
    same earnestness to the end, to the perfect fulfilment of our hopes, never
    growing careless, but imitating those who have the faith and the
    perseverance to inherit the promises. When God made the promise to Abraham,
    he swore by his own self, since it was impossible for him to swear by anyone
    greater: I will shower blessings on you and give you many descendants.
    &nbsp;Because of that, Abraham persevered and saw the promise fulfilled.
    Men, of course, swear an oath by something greater than themselves, and
    between men, confirmation by an oath puts an end to all dispute. In the same
    way, when God wanted to make the heirs to the promise thoroughly realise
    that his purpose was unalterable, he conveyed this by an oath; so that there
    would be two unalterable things in which it was impossible for God to be
    lying, and so that we, now we have found safety, should have a strong
    encouragement to take a firm grip on the hope that is held out to us. Here
    we have an anchor for our soul, as sure as it is firm, and reaching right
    through beyond the veil where Jesus has entered before us and on our behalf,
    to become a high priest of the order of Melchizedek, and for ever.

  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    The Lord said to Samuel, 'How long will you go on mourning over Saul when I
    have rejected him as king ofIsrael? Fill your horn with oil and go. I am
    sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem, for I have chosen myself a king among his
    sons.' Samuel replied, 'How can I go? When Saul hears of it he will kill
    me.' Then the Lord said, 'Take a heifer with you and say, "I have come to
    sacrifice to the Lord". Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and then I myself
    will tell you what you must do; you must anoint to me the one I point out to
    you.' Samuel did what the Lord ordered and went to Bethlehem. The elders of
    the town came trembling to meet him and asked, 'Seer, have you come with
    good intentions towards us?' 'Yes,' he replied 'I have come to sacrifice to
    the Lord. Purify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.' He purified
    Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. When they arrived, he
    caught sight of Eliab and thought, 'Surely the Lord's anointed one stands
    there before him', but the Lord said to Samuel, 'Take no notice of his
    appearance or his height for I have rejected him; God does not see as man
    sees; man looks at appearances but the Lord looks at the heart'. Jesse then
    called Abinadab and presented him to Samuel, who said, The Lord has not
    chosen this one either'. Jesse then presented Shammah, but Samuel said, The
    Lord has not chosen this one either'. Jesse presented his seven sons to
    Samuel, but Samuel said to Jesse, ‘The Lord has not chosen these'. He then
    asked Jesse, 'Are these all the sons you have?' He answered, 'There is still
    one left, the youngest; he is out looking after the sheep'. Then Samuel said
    to Jesse, 'Send for him; we will not sit down to eat until he comes'. Jesse
    had him sent for, a boy of fresh complexion, with fine eyes and pleasant
    bearing. The Lord said, 'Come, anoint him, for this is the one'. At this,
    Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him where he stood with his
    brothers; and the spirit of the Lord seized on David and stayed with him
    from that day on. As for Samuel, he rose and went to Ramah.

    One sabbath day Jesus happened to be taking a walk through the cornfields,
    and his disciples began to pick ears of corn as they went along. And the
    Pharisees said to him, 'Look, why are they doing something on the sabbath
    day that is forbidden?' And he replied, 'Did you never read what David did
    in his time of need when he and his followers were hungry - how he went into
    the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the loaves of
    offering which only the priests are allowed to eat, and how he also gave
    some to the men with him?' And he said to them, 'The sabbath was made for
    man, not man for the sabbath; the Son of Man is master even of the sabbath'.

    You remember that Melchizedek, king of Salem, a priest of God Most High,
    went to meet Abraham who was on his way back after defeating the kings, and
    blessed him; &nbsp;and also that it was to him that Abraham gave a tenth of
    all that he had. By the interpretation of his name, he is, first, 'king of
    righteousness' and also king of Salem, that is, 'king of peace'; &nbsp;he
    has no father, mother or ancestry, and his life has no beginning or ending;
    he is like the Son of God. He remains a priest for ever. This becomes even
    more clearly evident when there appears a second Melchizedek, who is a
    priest &nbsp;not by virtue of a law about physical descent, but by the power
    of an indestructible life. For it was about him that the prophecy was made:
    You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek, and for ever.

    David, having been led to Saul, said to him, 'Let no one lose heart on his
    account; your servant will go and fight this Philistine'. But Saul answered
    David, 'You cannot go and fight the Philistine, you are only a boy and he
    has been a warrior from his youth'. The Lord who rescued me from the claws
    of lion and bear' David said 'will rescue me from the power of this
    Philistine.' Then Saul said to David, 'Go, and the Lord be with you!' He
    took his staff in his hand, picked five smooth stones from the river bed,
    put them in his shepherd's bag, in his pouch, and with his sling in his hand
    he went to meet the Philistine. The Philistine, his shield-bearer in front
    of him, came nearer and nearer to David; and the Philistine looked at David,
    and what he saw filled him with scorn, because David was only a youth, a boy
    of fresh complexion and pleasant bearing. The Philistine said to him, 'Am I
    a dog for you to come against me with sticks?' And the Philistine cursed
    David by his gods. The Philistine said to David, 'Come over here and I will
    give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field'. But
    David answered the Philistine, 'You come against me with sword and spear and
    javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of
    the armies of Israel that you have dared to insult. Today the Lord will
    deliver you into my hand and I shall kill you; I will cut off your head, and
    this very day I will give your dead body and the bodies of the Philistine
    army to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth, so that all
    the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, and that all this assembly
    may know that it is not by sword or by spear that the Lord gives the
    victory, for the Lord is lord of the battle and he will deliver you into our
    power.' No sooner had the Philistine started forward to confront David than
    David left the line of battle and ran to meet the Philistine. Putting his
    hand in his bag, he took out a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine
    on the forehead; the stone penetrated his forehead and he fell on his face
    to the ground. Thus David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a
    stone and struck the Philistine down and killed him. David had no sword in
    his hand. Then David ran and, standing over the Philistine, seized his sword
    and drew it from the scabbard, and with this he killed him, cutting off his
    head. The Philistines saw that their champion was dead and took to flight.

    Jesus went into a synagogue, and there was a man there who had a withered
    hand. &nbsp;And they were watching him to see if he would cure him on the
    sabbath day, hoping for something to use against him. He said to the man
    with the withered hand, 'Stand up out in the middle!' Then he said to them,
    'Is it against the law on the sabbath day to do good, or to do evil; to save
    life, or to kill?' But they said nothing. &nbsp;Then, grieved to find them
    so obstinate, he looked angrily round at them, and said to the man, 'Stretch
    out your hand'. He stretched it out and his hand was better. The Pharisees
    went out and at once began to plot with the Herodians against him,
    discussing how to destroy him.

    to intercede for all who come to God through him. &nbsp;To suit us, the
    ideal high priest would have to be holy, innocent and uncontaminated, beyond
    the influence of sinners, and raised up above the heavens; &nbsp;one who
    would not need to offer sacrifices every day, as the other high priests do
    for their own sins and then for those of the people, because he has done
    this once and for all by offering himself. &nbsp;The Law appoints high
    priests who are men subject to weakness; but the promise on oath, which came
    after the Law, appointed the Son who is made perfect for ever. &nbsp;The
    great point of all that we have said is that we have a high priest of
    exactly this kind. He has his place at the right of the throne of divine
    Majesty in the heavens, &nbsp;and he is the minister of the sanctuary and of
    the true Tent of Meeting which the Lord, and not any man, set up. &nbsp;It
    is the duty of every high priest to offer gifts and sacrifices, and so this
    one too must have something to offer. &nbsp;In fact, if he were on earth, he
    would not be a priest at all, since there are others who make the offerings
    laid down by the Law &nbsp;and these only maintain the service of a model or
    a reflection of the heavenly realities. For Moses, when he had the Tent to
    build, was warned by God who said: See that you make everything according to
    the pattern shown you on the mountain. &nbsp;We&nbsp;have seen that he has
    been given a ministry of a far higher order, and to the same degree it is a
    better covenant of which he is the mediator, founded on better promises.

    On their way back, as David was returning after killing the Philistine, the
    women came out to meet King Saul from all the towns of Israel, singing and
    dancing to the sound of tambourine and lyre and cries of joy; &nbsp;and as
    they danced the women sang: 'Saul has killed his thousands, and David his
    tens of thousands.' &nbsp;Saul was very angry; the incident was not to his
    liking. 'They have given David the tens of thousands,' he said 'but me only
    the thousands; he has all but the kingship now.' &nbsp;And Saul&nbsp;turned
    a jealous eye on David from that day forward. &nbsp;Saul told Jonathan his
    son and all his servants of his intention to kill David. Now Jonathan,
    Saul's son, held David in great affection; &nbsp;and so Jonathan warned
    David; 'My father Saul is looking for a way to kill you,' he said 'so be on
    your guard tomorrow morning; hide away in some secret place. &nbsp;Then I
    will go out and keep my father company in the fields where you are hiding,
    and will talk to my father about you; I will find out what the situation is
    and let you know.' &nbsp;So Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father;
    he said, 'Let not the king sin against his servant David, for he has not
    sinned against you, and what he has done has been greatly to your advantage.
    &nbsp;He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine, and the
    Lord brought about a great victory for all Israel. You saw it yourself and
    rejoiced; why then sin against innocent blood in killing David without
    cause?' &nbsp;Saul was impressed by Jonathan's words and took an oath, 'As
    the Lord lives, I will not kill him'. &nbsp;Jonathan called David and told
    him all these things. Then Jonathan brought him to Saul, and David attended
    on him as before.

    Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lakeside, and great crowds from
    Galilee followed him. From Judaea, &nbsp;Jerusalem, Idumaea, Transjordania
    and the region of Tyre and Sidon, great numbers who had heard of all he was
    doing came to him. And he asked his disciples to have a boat ready for him
    because of the crowd, to keep him from being crushed. For he had cured so
    many that all who were afflicted in any way were crowding forward to touch
    him. And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, would fall down before
    him and shout, 'You are the Son of God!' But he warned them strongly not to

    We have seen that Jesus has been given a ministry of a far higher order, and
    to the same degree it is a better covenant of which he is the mediator,
    founded on better promises. If that first covenant had been without a fault,
    there would have been no need for a second one to replace it. And in fact
    God does find fault with them; he says: See, the days are coming - it is the
    Lord who speaks - when I will establish a new covenant with the House of
    Israel and the House of Judah, but not a covenant like the one I made with
    their ancestors on the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the
    land of Egypt. They abandoned that covenant of mine, and so I on my side
    deserted them. It is the Lord who speaks. No, this is the covenant I will
    make with the House of Israel when those days arrive - it is the Lord who
    speaks. I will put my laws into their minds and write them on their hearts.
    Then I will be their God and they shall be my people. There will be no
    further need for neighbour to try to teach neighbour, or brother to say to
    brother, 'Learn to know the Lord'. No, they will all know me, the least no
    less than the greatest, since I will forgive their iniquities and never call
    their sins to mind. By speaking of a new covenant, he implies that the first
    one is already old. Now anything old only gets more antiquated until in the
    end it disappears.

    A reading from the first Book of Samuel<span class="alindcha">24:3-21</span>
  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    Saul took three thousand men chosen from the whole of Israel and went in
    search of David and his men east of the Rocks of the Wild Goats. He came to
    the sheepfolds along the route where there was a cave, and went in to cover
    his feet. Now David and his men were sitting in the recesses of the cave;
    David's men said to him, 'Today is the day of which the Lord said to you, "I
    will deliver your enemy into your power, do what you like with him"'. David
    stood up and, unobserved, cut off the border of Saul's cloak.
    &nbsp;Afterwards David reproached himself for having cut off the border of
    Saul's cloak. He said to his men, ‘The Lord preserve me from doing such a
    thing to my lord and raising my hand against him, for he is the anointed of
    the Lord'. David gave his men strict instructions, forbidding them to attack
    Saul. Saul then left the cave and went on his way. After this, David too
    left the cave and called after Saul, 'My lord king!' Saul looked behind him
    and David bowed to the ground and did homage. Then David said to Saul, 'Why
    do you listen to the men who say to you, "David means to harm you"? Why,
    your own eyes have seen today how the Lord put you in my power in the cave
    and how I refused to kill you, but spared you. "I will not raise my hand
    against my lord," I said "for he is the anointed of the Lord." O my father,
    see, look at the border of your cloak in my hand. Since I cut off the border
    of your cloak, yet did not kill you, you must acknowledge frankly that there
    is neither malice nor treason in my mind. I have not offended against you,
    yet you hunt me down to take my life. May the Lord be judge between me and
    you, and may the Lord avenge me on you; but my hand shall not be laid on
    you. (As the old proverb says: Wickedness goes out from the wicked, and my
    hand will not be laid on you.) On whose trail has the king of Israel set
    out? On whose trail are you in hot pursuit? On the trail of a dead dog! On
    the trail of a single flea! May the Lord be the judge and decide between me
    and you; may he take up my cause and defend it and give judgment for me,
    freeing me from your power.' When David had finished saying these words to
    Saul, Saul said, 'Is that your voice, my son David?' And Saul wept aloud.
    'You are a more upright man than I,' he said to David 'for you have repaid
    me with good while I have repaid you with evil. Today you have crowned your
    goodness toward me since the Lord had put me in your power yet you did not
    kill me. When a man comes on his enemy, does he let him go unmolested? May
    the Lord reward you for the goodness you have shown me today. Now I know you
    will indeed reign and that the sovereignty inIsrael will be secure in your
    hands.

    There was a tent which comprised two compartments: the first, in which the
    lamp stand, the table and the presentation loaves were kept, was called the
    Holy Place; then beyond the second veil, an innermost part which was called
    the Holy of Holies. But now Christ has come, as the high priest of all the
    blessings which were to come. He has passed through the greater, the more
    perfect tent, which is better than the one made by men's hands because it is
    not of this created order; and he has entered the sanctuary once and for
    all, taking with him not the blood of goats and bull calves, but his own
    blood, having won an eternal redemption for us. The blood of goats and bulls
    and the ashes of a heifer are sprinkled on those who have incurred
    defilement and they restore the holiness of their outward lives; how much
    more effectively the blood of Christ, who offered himself as the perfect

    David returned from his rout of the Amalekites and spent two days in Ziklag.
    On the third day a man came from the camp where Saul had been, his garments
    torn and earth on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground and
    did homage. 'Where do you come from?' David asked him. 'I have escaped from
    the Israelite camp' he said. David said to him, 'What happened? Tell me.' He
    replied, 'The people have fled from the battlefield and many of them have
    fallen. Saul and his son Jonathan are dead too.' Then David took hold of his
    garments and tore them, and all the men with him did the same. They mourned
    and wept and fasted until the evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, for the
    people of the Lord and for the House of Israel, because they had fallen by
    the sword. And David said: Alas, the glory of Israel has been slain on your
    heights! How did the heroes fall? Saul and Jonathan, loved and lovely,
    neither in life, nor in death, were divided. Swifter than eagles were they,
    stronger were they than lions. O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul who
    clothed you in scarlet and fine linen, who set brooches of gold on your
    garments. How did the heroes fall in the thick of the battle? O Jonathan, in
    your death I am stricken, I am desolate for you, Jonathan my brother. Very
    dear to me you were, your love to me more wonderful than the love of a
    woman. How did the heroes fall and the battle armour fail?
