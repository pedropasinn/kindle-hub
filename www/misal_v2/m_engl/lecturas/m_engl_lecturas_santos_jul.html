    Thomas, called the Twin, who was one of the Twelve, was not with them when
    Jesus came. When the disciples said, 'We have seen the Lord', he answered,
    'Unless I see the holes that the nails made in his hands and can put my
    finger into the holes they made, and unless I can put my hand into his side,
    I refuse to believe'. Eight days later the disciples were in the house again
    and Thomas was with them. The doors were closed, but Jesus came in and stood
    among them. 'Peace be with you' he said. Then he spoke to Thomas, 'Put your
    finger here; look, here are my hands. Give me your hand; put it into my
    side. Doubt no longer but believe.' Thomas replied, 'My Lord and my God!'
    Jesus said to him: 'You believe because you can see me. Happy are those who
    have not seen and yet believe.'

    Jesus said to his disciples: When the Son of Man comes in his glory,
    escorted by all the angels, then he will take his seat on his throne of
    glory. &nbsp;All the nations will be assembled before him and he will
    separate men one from another as the shepherd separates sheep from goats.
    &nbsp;He will place the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left.
    &nbsp;Then the King will say to those on his right hand, "Come, you whom my
    Father has blessed, take for your heritage the kingdom prepared for you
    since the foundation of the world. &nbsp;For I was hungry and you gave me
    food; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; I was a stranger and you made me
    welcome; &nbsp;naked and you clothed me, sick and you visited me, in prison
    and you came to see me." &nbsp;Then the virtuous will say to him in reply,
    "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you; or thirsty and give you
    drink? &nbsp;When did we see you a stranger and make you welcome; naked and
    clothe you; &nbsp;sick or in prison and go to see you?" &nbsp;And the King
    will answer, "I tell you solemnly, in so far as you did this to one of the
    least of these brothers of mine, you did it to me". &nbsp;Next he will say
    to those on his left hand, "Go away from me, with your curse upon you, to
    the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. &nbsp;For I was
    hungry and you never gave me food; I was thirsty and you never gave me
    anything to drink; &nbsp;I was a stranger and you never made me welcome,
    naked and you never clothed me, sick and in prison and you never visited
    me." &nbsp;Then it will be their turn to ask, "Lord, when did we see you
    hungry or thirsty, a stranger or naked, sick or in prison, and did not come
    to your help?" &nbsp;Then he will answer, "I tell you solemnly, in so far as
    you neglected to do this to one of the least of these, you neglected to do
    it to me". &nbsp;And they will go away to eternal punishment, and the
    virtuous to eternal life.'

    People were bringing little children to Jesus, for him to touch them. The
    disciples turned them away, but when Jesus saw this he was indignant and
    said to them, 'Let the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it
    is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. I tell you solemnly,
    anyone who does not welcome the kingdom of God like a little child will
    never enter it.' Then he put his arms round them, laid his hands on them and

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'It is not those who say to me, "Lord, Lord",

    Father in heaven. When the day comes many will say to me, "Lord, Lord, did

    catches and scatters them. This is because he works for pay and has no

    These also I must lead, and they will hear my voice, and there will be one
    flock, one shepherd. This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my
    life in order to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it
    down on my own. I have power to lay it down, and power to take it up again.

    Jesus began to teach by the lakeside, but such a huge crowd gathered round
    him that he got into a boat on the lake and sat there. The people were all
    along the shore, at the water's edge. He taught them many things in
    parables, and in the course of his teaching he said to them, 'Listen!,
    Imagine a sower going out to sow. Now it happened that, as he sowed, some of
    the seed fell on the edge of the path, and the birds came and ate it up.
    Some seed fell on rocky ground where it found little soil and sprang up
    straightaway, because there was no depth of earth; and when the sun came up
    it was scorched and, not having any roots, it withered away. Some seed fell
    into thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it produced no crop.
    And some seeds fell into rich soil and, growing tall and strong, produced
    crop; and yielded thirty, sixty, even a hundredfold.' And he said, 'Listen,
    anyone who has ears to hear!' When he was alone, the Twelve, together with
    the others who formed his company, asked what the parables meant.
  </p>
  <p>
    He said to them, 'Do you not understand this parable? Then how will you
    understand any of the parables? What the sower is sowing is the word. Those
    on the edge of the path where the word is sown are people who have no sooner
    heard it than Satan comes and carries away the word that was sown in them.
    Similarly, those who receive the seed on patches of rock are people who,
    when first they hear the word, welcome it at once with joy. But they have no
    root in them, they do not last; should some trial come, or some persecution
    on account of the word, they fall away at once. Then there are others who
    receive the seed in thorns. These have heard the word, but the worries of
    this world, the lure of riches and all the other passions come in to choke
    the word, and so it produces nothing. And there are those who have received
    the seed in rich soil: they hear the word and accept it and yield a harvest,
    thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.'

    The love of Christ overwhelms us when we reflect that if one man has died
    for all, then all men should be dead; and the reason he died for all was so
    that living men should live no longer for themselves, but for him who died
    and was raised to life for them. From now onwards, therefore, we do not
    judge anyone by the standards of the flesh. Even if we did once know Christ
    in the flesh, that is not how we know him now. And for anyone who is in
    Christ, there is a new creation; the old creation has gone, and now the new
    one is here.

    It was very early on the first day of the week and still dark, when Mary of
    Magdala came to the tomb. She saw that the stone had been moved away from
    the tomb and came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one
    whom Jesus loved. 'They have taken the Lord out of the tomb,' she said, 'and
    we don't know where they have put him.'But Mary was standing outside near
    the tomb, weeping. Then, as she wept, she stooped to look inside, and saw
    two angels in white sitting where the body of Jesus had been, one at the
    head, the other at the feet. They said, 'Woman, why are you weeping?' 'They
    have taken my Lord away,' she replied, 'and I don't know where they have put
    him.' As she said this she turned round and saw Jesus standing there, though
    she did not realise that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, 'Woman, why are
    you weeping? Who are you looking for?' Supposing him to be the gardener, she
    said, 'Sir, if you have taken him away, tell me where you have put him, and
    I will go and remove him.' Jesus said, 'Mary!' She turned round then and
    said to him in Hebrew, 'Rabbuni!'-which means Master. Jesus said to her, 'Do
    not cling to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to
    the brothers, and tell them: I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to
    my God and your God.' So Mary of Magdala told the disciples, 'I have seen
    the Lord,' and that he had said these things to her.

    We are only the earthenware jars that hold this treasure, to make it clear
    that such an overwhelming power comes from God and not from us. We are in
    difficulties on all sides, but never cornered; we see no answer to our
    problems, but never despair; we have been persecuted, but never deserted;
    knocked down, but never killed; always, wherever we may be, we carry with us
    in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus, too, may always
    be seen in our body. Indeed, while we are still alive, we are consigned to
    our death every day, for the sake of Jesus, so that in our mortal flesh the
    life of Jesus, too, may be openly shown. So death is at work in us, but life
    in you. But as we have the same spirit of faith that is mentioned in
    scripture - I believed, and therefore I spoke - we too believe and therefore
    we too speak, knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus to life will raise
    us with Jesus in our turn, and put us by his side and you with us. You see,
    all this is for your benefit, so that the more grace is multiplied among
    people, the more thanksgiving there will be, to the glory of God.

    The mother of Zebedee's sons came with her sons to make a request of him,
    and bowed low; land he said to her, 'What is it you want?' She said to him,
    'Promise that these two sons of mine may sit one at your right hand and the
    other at your left in your kingdom.' Jesus answered, 'You do not know what
    you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am going to drink?' They
    replied, 'We can.' He said to them, 'Very well; you shall drink my cup, but
    as for seats at my right hand and my left, these are not mine to grant; they
    belong to those to whom they have been allotted by my Father.' When the
    other ten heard this they were indignant with the two brothers. But Jesus
    called them to him and said, 'You know that among the gentiles the rulers
    lord it over them, and great men make their authority felt. Among you this
    is not to happen. No; anyone who wants to become great among you must be
    your servant, and anyone who wants to be first among you must be your slave,

    My dear people, let us love one another since love comes from God and
    everyone who loves is begotten by God and knows God. Anyone who fails to
    love can never have known God, because God is love. God's love for us was
    revealed when God sent into the world his only Son so that we could have
    life through him; this is the love I mean: not our love for God, but God's
    love for us when he sent his Son to be the sacrifice that takes our sins
    away. My dear people, since God has loved us so much, we too should love one
    another. No one has ever seen God; but as long as we love one another God
    will live in us and his love will be complete in us. We can know that we are
    living in him and he is living in us because he lets us share his Spirit. We
    ourselves saw and we testify that the Father sent his Son as saviour of the
    world. If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in
    him, and he in God. We ourselves have known and put our faith in God's love
    towards ourselves. God is love and anyone who lives in love lives in God,

    Many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to sympathise with them over their
    brother. When Martha heard that Jesus had come she went to meet him. Mary
    remained sitting in the house. Martha said to Jesus, 'If you had been here,
    my brother would not have died, but I know that, even now, whatever you ask
    of God, he will grant you'. 'Your brother' said Jesus to her 'will rise
    again.' Martha said, 'I know he will rise again at the resurrection on the
    last day'. Jesus said: 'I am the resurrection. If anyone believes in me,
    even though he dies he will live, and whoever lives and believes in me will
    never die. Do you believe this?' 'Yes, Lord,' she said 'I believe that you
    are the Christ, the Son of God, the one who was to come into this world.'

    Jesus came to a village, and a woman named Martha welcomed him into her
    house. She had a sister called Mary, who sat down at the Lord's feet and
    listened to him speaking. Now Martha who was distracted with all the serving
    said, 'Lord, do you not care that my sister is leaving me to do the serving
    all by myself? Please tell her to help me.' But the Lord answered: 'Martha,
    Martha,' he said 'you worry and fret about so many things, and yet few are
