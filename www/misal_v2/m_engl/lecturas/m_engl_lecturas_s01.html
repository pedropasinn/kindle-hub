    Here is my servant whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom my soul delights. I
    have endowed him with my spirit that he may bring true justice to the
    nations. He does not cry out or shout aloud, or make his voice heard in the
    streets. He does not break the crushed reed, nor quench the wavering flame.
    Faithfully he brings true justice; he will neither waver, nor be crushed
    until true justice is established on earth, for the islands are awaiting his
    law. Thus says God, the Lord, he who created the heavens and spread them
    out, who gave shape to the earth and what comes from it, who gave breath to
    its people and life to the creatures that move in it: I, the Lord, have
    called you to serve the cause of right; I have taken you by the hand and
    formed you; I have appointed you as covenant of the people and light of the
    nations, to open the eyes of the blind, to free captives from prison, and
    those who live in darkness from the dungeon.

    Six days before the Passover, Jesus went to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom
    he had raised from the dead. They gave a dinner for him there; Martha waited
    on them and Lazarus was among those at table. Mary brought in a pound of
    very costly ointment, pure nard, and with it anointed the feet of Jesus,
    wiping them with her hair; the house was full of the scent of the ointment.
    Then Judas Iscariot - one of his disciples, the man who was to betray him -
    said, 'Why wasn't this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and the
    money given to the poor?' He said this, not because he cared about the poor,
    but because he was a thief; he was in charge of the common fund and used to
    help himself to the contributions. So Jesus said, 'Leave her alone; she had
    to keep this scent for the day of my burial. You have the poor with you
    always, you will not always have me.' Meanwhile a large number of Jews heard
    that he was there and came not only on account of Jesus but also to see
    Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead. Then the chief priests decided to
    kill Lazarus as well, since it was on his account that many of the Jews were
    leaving them and believing in Jesus.

    While at supper with his disciples, Jesus was troubled in spirit and
    declared, 'I tell you most solemnly, one of you will betray me'. The
    disciples looked at one another, wondering which he meant. The disciple
    Jesus loved was reclining next to Jesus; Simon Peter signed to him and said,
    'Ask who it is he means', so leaning back on Jesus' breast he said, 'Who is
    it, Lord?' 'lt is the one' replied Jesus 'to whom I give the piece of bread
    that I shall dip in the dish.' He dipped the piece of bread and gave it to
    Judas son of Simon Iscariot. At that instant, after Judas had taken the
    bread, Satan entered him. Jesus then said, 'What you are going to do, do
    quickly'. None of the others at table understood the reason he said this.
    Since Judas had charge of the common fund, some of them thought Jesus was
    telling him, 'Buy what we need for the festival', or telling him to give
    something to the poor. As soon as Judas had taken the piece of bread he went
    out. Night had fallen. When he had gone Jesus said: 'Now has the Son of Man
    been glorified, and in him God has been glorified. If God has been glorified
    in him, God will in turn glorify him in himself, and will glorify him very
    soon. 'My little children, I shall not be with you much longer. You will
    look for me, and, as I told the Jews, where I am going, you cannot come.
    Simon Peter said, 'Lord, where are you going?' Jesus replied, 'Where I am
    going you cannot follow me now; you will follow me later'. Peter said to
    him, 'Why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.' 'Lay
    down your life for me?' answered Jesus. 'I tell you most solemnly, before
    the cock crows you will have disowned me three times.

    One of the Twelve, the man called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
    and said, 'What are you prepared to give me if I hand him over to you?' They
    paid him thirty silver pieces, and from that moment he looked for an
    opportunity to betray him. Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the
    disciples came to Jesus to say, 'Where do you want us to make the
    preparations for you to eat the passover?' 'Go to so-and-so in the city' he
    replied 'and say to him, "The Master says: My time is near. It is at your
    house that I am keeping Passover with my disciples."' The disciples did what
    Jesus told them and prepared the Passover. When evening came he was at table
    with the twelve disciples. And while they were eating he said 'I tell you
    solemnly, one of you is about to betray me' They were greatly distressed and
    started asking him in turn, 'Not I, Lord, surely?' He answered, 'Someone who
    has dipped his hand into the dish with me, will betray me. The Son of Man is
    going to his fate, as the scriptures say he will, but alas for that man by
    whom the Son of Man is betrayed! Better for that man if he had never been
    born!' Judas, who was to betray him; asked in his turn, 'Not I, Rabbi,

    Jesus came to Nazara, where he had been brought up, and went into the
    synagogue on the sabbath day as he usually did. He stood up to read and they
    handed him the scroll of the prophet Isaiah. Unrolling the scroll he found
    the place where it is written: The spirit of the Lord has been given to me,
    for he has anointed me. He has sent me to bring the good news to the poor,
    to proclaim liberty to captives and to the blind new sight, to set the
    downtrodden free, to proclaim the Lord's year of favour. He then rolled up

    fourteenth day of the month when the whole assembly of the community of

    then be taken and put on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses

    the first-born in the land of Egypt, man and beast alike, and I shall deal
    out punishment to all the gods of Egypt, I am the Lord! The blood shall
    serve to mark the houses that you live in. When I see the blood I will pass
    over you and you shall escape the destroying plague when I strike the land
    of Egypt. This day is to be a day of remembrance for you, and you must
    celebrate it as a feast in the Lord's honour. For all generations you are to
    declare it a day of festival, for ever.

    This is what I received from the Lord, and in turn passed on to you: that on
    the same night that he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took some bread, and
    thanked God for it and broke it, and he said, 'This is my body, which is for
    you; do this as a memorial of me'. In the same way he took the cup after
    supper, and said, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Whenever you
    drink it, do this as a memorial of me.' Until the Lord comes, therefore,
    every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are proclaiming his

    It was before the festival of the Passover, and Jesus knew that the hour had
    come for him to pass from this world to the Father. He had always loved
    those who were his in the world, but now he showed how perfect his love was.
    They were at supper, and the devil had already put it into the mind of Judas
    Iscariot son of Simon, to betray him. Jesus knew that the Father had put
    everything into his hands, and that he had come from God and was returning
    to God, and he got up from table, removed his outer garment and, taking a
    towel, wrapped it round his waist; he then poured water into a basin and
    began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel he was
    wearing. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, 'Lord, are you going to
    wash my feet?' Jesus answered, 'At the moment you do not know what I am
    doing, but later you will understand'. 'Never!' said Peter 'You shall never
    wash my feet.' Jesus replied, 'If I do not wash you, you can have nothing in
    common with me'. 'Then, Lord,' said Simon Peter 'not only my feet, but my
    hands and my head as well!' Jesus said, 'No one who has taken a bath needs
    washing, he is clean all over. You too are clean, though not all of you
    are.' He knew who was going to betray him, that was why he said, 'though not
    all of you are'. When he had washed their feet and put on his clothes again
    he went back to the table. 'Do you understand' he said 'what I have done to
    you? You call me Master and Lord, and rightly; so I am. If I, then, the Lord
    and Master, have washed your feet, you should wash each other's feet. I have
    given you an example so that you may copy what I have done to you.
