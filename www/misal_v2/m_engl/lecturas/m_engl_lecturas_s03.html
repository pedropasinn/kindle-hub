  </p>
  <p>
    In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was
    a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a mighty wind
    swept over the waters.<br />Then God said, “Let there be light,” and there
    was light. God saw how good the light was. God then separated the light from
    the darkness. God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called
    “night.” Thus evening came, and morning followed — the first day.<br />Then
    God said, “Let there be a dome in the middle of the waters, to separate one
    body of water from the other.” And so it happened: God made the dome, and it
    separated the water above the dome from the water below it. God called the
    dome “the sky.” Evening came, and morning followed — the second day.<br />Then
    God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered into a single basin, so
    that the dry land may appear.” And so it happened: the water under the sky
    was gathered into its basin, and the dry land appeared. God called the dry
    land “the earth,” and the basin of the water he called “the sea.” God saw
    how good it was. Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth vegetation: every
    kind of plant that bears seed and every kind of fruit tree on earth that
    bears fruit with its seed in it.” And so it happened: the earth brought
    forth every kind of plant that bears seed and every kind of fruit tree on
    earth that bears fruit with its seed in it. God saw how good it was. Evening
    came, and morning followed — the third day.<br />Then God said: “Let there
    be lights in the dome of the sky, to separate day from night. Let them mark
    the fixed times, the days and the years, and serve as luminaries in the dome
    of the sky, to shed light upon the earth.” And so it happened: God made the
    two great lights, the greater one to govern the day, and the lesser one to
    govern the night; and he made the stars. God set them in the dome of the
    sky, to shed light upon the earth, to govern the day and the night, and to
    separate the light from the darkness. God saw how good it was. Evening came,
    and morning followed — the fourth day.<br />Then God said, “Let the water
    teem with an abundance of living creatures, and on the earth let birds fly
    beneath the dome of the sky.” And so it happened: God created the great sea
    monsters and all kinds of swimming creatures with which the water teems, and
    all kinds of winged birds. God saw how good it was, and God blessed them,
    saying, “Be fertile, multiply, and fill the water of the seas; and let the
    birds multiply on the earth.” Evening came, and morning followed — the fifth
    day.<br />Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth all kinds of living
    creatures: cattle, creeping things, and wild animals of all kinds.” And so
    it happened: God made all kinds of wild animals, all kinds of cattle, and
    all kinds of creeping things of the earth. God saw how good it was. Then God
    said: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. Let them have
    dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and the cattle, and
    over all the wild animals and all the creatures that crawl on the ground.”
    God created man in his image; in the image of God he created him; male and
    female he created them. God blessed them, saying: “Be fertile and multiply;
    fill the earth and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, the
    birds of the air, and all the living things that move on the earth.” God
    also said: “See, I give you every seed-bearing plant all over the earth and
    every tree that has seed-bearing fruit on it to be your food; and to all the
    animals of the land, all the birds of the air, and all the living creatures
    that crawl on the ground, I give all the green plants for food.” And so it
    happened. God looked at everything he had made, and he found it very good.
    Evening came, and morning followed — the sixth day.<br />Thus the heavens
    and the earth and all their array were completed. Since on the seventh day
    God was finished with the work he had been doing, he rested on the seventh
    day from all the work he had undertaken.

  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    God put Abraham to the test. He called to him, “Abraham!” “Here I am,” he
    replied. Then God said: “Take your son Isaac, your only one, whom you love,
    and go to the land of Moriah. There you shall offer him up as a holocaust on
    a height that I will point out to you.” Early the next morning Abraham
    saddled his donkey, took with him his son Isaac and two of his servants as
    well, and with the wood that he had cut for the holocaust, set out for the
    place of which God had told him.<br />On the third day Abraham got sight of
    the place from afar. Then he said to his servants: “Both of you stay here
    with the donkey, while the boy and I go on over yonder. We will worship and
    then come back to you.” Thereupon Abraham took the wood for the holocaust
    and laid it on his son Isaac's shoulders, while he himself carried the fire
    and the knife. As the two walked on together, Isaac spoke to his father
    Abraham: “Father!” Isaac said. “Yes, son,” he replied. Isaac continued,
    “Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the sheep for the holocaust?”
    “Son,” Abraham answered, “God himself will provide the sheep for the
    holocaust.” Then the two continued going forward.<br />When they came to the
    place of which God had told him, Abraham built an altar there and arranged
    the wood on it. Next he tied up his son Isaac, and put him on top of the
    wood on the altar. Then he reached out and took the knife to slaughter his
    son. But the Lord's messenger called to him from heaven, “Abraham, Abraham!”
    “Here I am!” he answered. “Do not lay your hand on the boy,” said the
    messenger. “Do not do the least thing to him. I know now how devoted you are
    to God, since you did not withhold from me your own beloved son.” As Abraham
    looked about, he spied a ram caught by its horns in the thicket. So he went
    and took the ram and offered it up as a holocaust in place of his son.
    Abraham named the site Yahweh-yireh; hence people now say, “On the mountain
    the Lord will see.”<br />Again the Lord's messenger called to Abraham from
    heaven and said: “I swear by myself, declares the Lord, that because you
    acted as you did in not withholding from me your beloved son, I will bless
    you abundantly and make your descendants as countless as the stars of the
    sky and the sands of the seashore; your descendants shall take possession of
    the gates of their enemies, and in your descendants all the nations of the
    earth shall find blessing — all this because you obeyed my command.”

    The Lord said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites
    to go forward. And you, lift up your staff and, with hand outstretched over
    the sea, split the sea in two, that the Israelites may pass through it on
    dry land. But I will make the Egyptians so obstinate that they will go in
    after them. Then I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all his army, his
    chariots and charioteers. The Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when
    I receive glory through Pharaoh and his chariots and charioteers.”<br />The
    angel of God, who had been leading Israel's camp, now moved and went around
    behind them. The column of cloud also, leaving the front, took up its place
    behind them, so that it came between the camp of the Egyptians and that of
    Israel. But the cloud now became dark, and thus the night passed without the
    rival camps coming any closer together all night long. Then Moses stretched
    out his hand over the sea, and the Lord swept the sea with a strong east
    wind throughout the night and so turned it into dry land. When the water was
    thus divided, the Israelites marched into the midst of the sea on dry land,
    with the water like a wall to their right and to their left.<br />The
    Egyptians followed in pursuit; all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and
    charioteers went after them right into the midst of the sea. In the night
    watch just before dawn the Lord cast through the column of the fiery cloud
    upon the Egyptian force a glance that threw it into a panic; and he so
    clogged their chariot wheels that they could hardly drive. With that the
    Egyptians sounded the retreat before Israel, because the Lord was fighting
    for them against the Egyptians.<br />Then the Lord told Moses, “Stretch out
    your hand over the sea, that the water may flow back upon the Egyptians,
    upon their chariots and their charioteers.” So Moses stretched out his hand
    over the sea, and at dawn the sea flowed back to its normal depth. The
    Egyptians were fleeing head on toward the sea, when the Lord hurled them
    into its midst. As the water flowed back, it covered the chariots and the
    charioteers of Pharaoh's whole army which had followed the Israelites into
    the sea. Not a single one of them escaped. But the Israelites had marched on
    dry land through the midst of the sea, with the water like a wall to their
    right and to their left. Thus the Lord saved Israel on that day from the
    power of the Egyptians. When Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the
    seashore and beheld the great power that the Lord had shown against the
    Egyptians, they feared the Lord and believed in him and in his servant
    Moses.<br />Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord: I will
    sing to the Lord, for he is gloriously triumphant; horse and chariot he has
    cast into the sea.

    The One who has become your husband is your Maker; his name is the Lord of
    hosts; your redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, called God of all the earth.
    The Lord calls you back, like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, a wife
    married in youth and then cast off, says your God. For a brief moment I
    abandoned you, but with great tenderness I will take you back. In an
    outburst of wrath, for a moment I hid my face from you; but with enduring
    love I take pity on you, says the Lord, your redeemer. This is for me like
    the days of Noah, when I swore that the waters of Noah should never again
    deluge the earth; so I have sworn not to be angry with you, or to rebuke
    you. Though the mountains leave their place and the hills be shaken, my love
    shall never leave you nor my covenant of peace be shaken, says the Lord, who
    has mercy on you. O afflicted one, storm-battered and unconsoled, I lay your
    pavements in carnelians, and your foundations in sapphires; I will make your
    battlements of rubies, your gates of carbuncles, and all your walls of
    precious stones. All your children shall be taught by the Lord, and great
    shall be the peace of your children. In justice shall you be established,

    have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and
    without price. Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread, and
    your labour for that which does not satisfy? Listen carefully to me, and eat
    what is good, and delight yourselves in rich food. Incline your ear, and
    come to me; listen, so that you may live. I will make with you an
    everlasting covenant, my steadfast, sure love for David.
  </p>
  <p class="plectura">
    See, I made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander for the
    peoples. See, you shall call nations that you do not know, and nations that
    do not know you shall run to you, because of the Lord your God, the Holy One
    of Israel, for he has glorified you.
  </p>
  <p class="plectura">
    Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near; let the
    wicked forsake their way, and the unrighteous their thoughts; let them
    return to the Lord, that he may have mercy on them, and to our God, for he
    will abundantly pardon.
  </p>
  <p class="plectura">
    For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says the
    Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher
    than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.
  </p>
  <p class="plectura">
    For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return there
    until they have watered the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving
    seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so shall my word be that goes out
    from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that
    which I purpose, and succeed in the thing for which I sent it."

    Hear, O Israel, the commandments of life: listen, and know prudence! How is
    it, Israel, that you are in the land of your foes, grown old in a foreign
    land, defiled with the dead, accounted with those destined for the
    netherworld? You have forsaken the fountain of wisdom! Had you walked in the
    way of God, you would have dwelt in enduring peace. Learn where prudence is,
    where strength, where understanding; that you may know also where are length
    of days, and life, where light of the eyes, and peace. Who has found the
    place of wisdom, who has entered into her treasuries?<br />The One who knows
    all things knows her; he has probed her by his knowledge. The One who
    established the earth for all time, and filled it with four-footed beasts;
    he who dismisses the light, and it departs, calls it, and it obeys him
    trembling; before whom the stars at their posts shine and rejoice; when he
    calls them, they answer, “Here we are!” shining with joy for their Maker.
    Such is our God; no other is to be compared to him:<br />He has traced out
    the whole way of understanding, and has given her to Jacob, his servant, to
    Israel, his beloved son.<br />Since then she has appeared on earth, and
    moved among people. She is the book of the precepts of God, the law that
    endures forever; all who cling to her will live, but those will die who
    forsake her. Turn, O Jacob, and receive her: walk by her light toward
    splendor. Give not your glory to another, your privileges to an alien race.
    Blessed are we, O Israel; for what pleases God is known to us!

    "The word of the Lord came to me: Son of man, when the house of Israel lived
    on their own soil, they defiled it with their ways and their deeds; their
    conduct in my sight was unclean. So I poured out my wrath upon them for the
    blood that they had shed upon the land, and for the idols with which they
    had defiled it. I scattered them among the nations, and they were disposed
    through the countries; in accordance with their conduct and their deeds I
    judged them.

    Brothers and sisters: Are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ
    Jesus were baptized into his death?<br />We were indeed buried with him
    through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead
    by the glory of the Father, we too might live in newness of life.<br />For
    if we have grown into union with him through a death like his, we shall also
    be united with him in the resurrection. We know that our old self was
    crucified with him, so that our sinful body might be done away with, that we
    might no longer be in slavery to sin. For a dead person has been absolved
    from sin. If, then, we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also
    live with him. We know that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more;
    death no longer has power over him. As to his death, he died to sin once and
    for all; as to his life, he lives for God. Consequently, you too must think
    of yourselves as being dead to sin and living for God in Christ Jesus.

    After the sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, 2 Mary
    Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. And behold, there was a
    great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven,
    approached, rolled back the stone, and sat upon it. His appearance was like
    lightning and his clothing was white as snow. The guards were shaken with
    fear of him and became like dead men. Then the angel said to the women in
    reply, “Do not be afraid! I know that you are seeking Jesus the crucified.
    He is not here, for he has been raised just as he said. Come and see the
    place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has been
    raised from the dead, and he is going before you to Galilee; there you will
    see him.' Behold, I have told you.” Then they went away quickly from the
    tomb, fearful yet overjoyed, and ran to announce this to his disciples. And
    behold, Jesus met them on their way and greeted them. They approached,
    embraced his feet, and did him homage. Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be
    afraid. Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.”

    When the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James, and
    Salome bought spices so that they might go and anoint him. Very early when
    the sun had risen, on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb. They
    were saying to one another, “Who will roll back the stone for us from the
    entrance to the tomb?” When they looked up, they saw that the stone had been
    rolled back; it was very large. On entering the tomb they saw a young man
    sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe, and they were utterly
    amazed. He said to them, “Do not be amazed! You seek Jesus of Nazareth, the
    crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Behold the place where they
    laid him. But go and tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going before you
    to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.'”

    At daybreak on the first day of the week the women who had come from Galilee
    with Jesus took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. They
    found the stone rolled away from the tomb; but when they entered, they did
    not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were puzzling over this,
    behold, two men in dazzling garments appeared to them. They were terrified
    and bowed their faces to the ground. They said to them, “Why do you seek the
    living one among the dead? He is not here, but he has been raised. Remember
    what he said to you while he was still in Galilee, that the Son of Man must
    be handed over to sinners and be crucified, and rise on the third day.” And
    they remembered his words. Then they returned from the tomb and announced
    all these things to the eleven and to all the others.The women were Mary
    Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James; the others who accompanied
    them also told this to the apostles, but their story seemed like nonsense
    and they did not believe them. But Peter got up and ran to the tomb, bent
    down, and saw the burial cloths alone; then he went home amazed at what had
    happened.
