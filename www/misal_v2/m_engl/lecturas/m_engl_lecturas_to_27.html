    Let me sing to my friend the song of his love for his vineyard. My friend
    had a vineyard on a fertile hillside. &nbsp;He dug the Soil, cleared it of
    stones, and planted choice vines in it. In the middle he built a tower, he
    dug a press there too. He expected it to yield grapes, but sour grapes were
    all that it gave. &nbsp;And now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,
    I ask you to judge between my vineyard and me. &nbsp;What could I have done
    for my vineyard that I have not done? I expected it to yield grapes. Why did
    it yield sour grapes instead? &nbsp;Very well, I will tell you what I am
    going to do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge for it to be grazed
    on, and knock down its wall for it to be trampled on. &nbsp;I will lay it
    waste, unpruned, undug; overgrown by the briar and the thorn. I will command
    the clouds to rain no rain on it. &nbsp;Yes, the vineyard of the Lord of
    hosts is the House of Israel, and the men of Judah that chosen plant. He
    expected justice, but found bloodshed, integrity, but only a cry of
    distress.

    Jesus said to the chief priests and the elders of the people: 'Listen to
    another parable. There was a man, a landowner, who planted a vineyard; he
    fenced it round, dug a winepress in it and built a tower; then he leased it
    to tenants and went abroad. &nbsp;When vintage time drew near he sent his
    servants to the tenants to collect his produce. &nbsp;But the tenants seized
    his servants, thrashed one, killed another and stoned a third. &nbsp;Next he
    sent some more servants, this time a larger number, and they dealt with them
    in the same way. &nbsp;Finally he sent his son to them. "They will respect
    my son" he said. &nbsp;But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each
    other, "This is the heir. Come on, let us kill him and take over his
    inheritance." &nbsp;So they seized him and threw him out of the vineyard and
    killed him. &nbsp;Now when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do
    to those tenants?' &nbsp;They answered, 'He will bring those wretches to a
    wretched end and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will deliver the
    produce to him when the season arrives'. &nbsp;Jesus said to them, 'Have you
    never read in the scriptures: It was the stone rejected by the builders that
    became the keystone. This was the Lord's doing and it is wonderful to
    see?&nbsp;I tell you, then, that the kingdom of God will be taken from you
    and given to a people who will produce its fruit.'

  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    The Lord God said, 'It is not good that the man should be alone. I will make
    him a helpmate.' &nbsp;So from the soil the Lord God fashioned all the wild
    beasts and all the birds of heaven. These he brought to the man to see what
    he would call them; each one was to bear the name the man would give it.
    &nbsp;The man gave names to all the cattle, all the birds of heaven and all
    the wild beasts. But no helpmate suitable for man was found for him.
    &nbsp;So the Lord God made the man fall into a deep sleep. And while he
    slept, he took one of his ribs and enclosed it in flesh. &nbsp;The Lord God
    built the rib he had taken from the man into a woman, and brought her to the
    man. &nbsp;The man exclaimed: 'This at last is bone from my bones, and flesh
    from my flesh! This is to be called woman, for this was taken from man.'
    &nbsp;This is why a man leaves his father and mother and joins himself to
    his wife, and they become one body.

    We see in Jesus one who was for a short while made lower than the angels and
    is now crowned with glory and splendour because he submitted to death; by
    God's grace he had to experience death for all mankind. &nbsp;As it was his
    purpose to bring a great many of his sons into glory, it was appropriate
    that God, for whom everything exists and through whom everything exists,
    should make perfect, through suffering, the leader who would take them to
    their salvation. &nbsp;For the one who sanctifies, and the ones who are
    sanctified, are of the same stock; that is why he openly calls them
    brothers.

    Some Pharisees approached Jesus and asked, 'Is it against the law for a man
    to divorce his wife?' They were testing him. &nbsp;He answered them, 'What
    did Moses command you?' &nbsp;'Moses allowed us' they said 'to draw up a
    writ of dismissal and so to divorce.' &nbsp;Then Jesus said to them, 'It was
    because you were so unteachable that he wrote this commandment for you.
    &nbsp;But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.
    &nbsp;This is why a man must leave father and mother, &nbsp;and the two
    become one body. They are no longer two, therefore, but one body. &nbsp;So
    then, what God has united, man must not divide.' &nbsp;Back in the house the
    disciples questioned him again about this, &nbsp;and he said to them, 'The
    man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty of adultery against
    her. &nbsp;And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another she is
    guilty of adultery too.' &nbsp;People were bringing little children to him,
    for him to touch them. The disciples turned them away, &nbsp;but when Jesus
    saw this he was indignant and said to them, 'Let the little children come to
    me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God
    belongs. &nbsp;I tell you solemnly, anyone who does not welcome the kingdom
    of God like a little child will never enter it.' &nbsp;Then he put his arms
    round them, laid his hands on them and gave them his blessing.

    A reading from the&nbsp;prophet Jonah<span class="alindcha">1:1-2:1.11</span>
  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    The word of the Lord was addressed to Jonah son of Amittai: &nbsp;'Up!' he
    said 'Go to Nineveh, the great city, and inform them that their wickedness
    has become known to me.' &nbsp;Jonah decided to run away from the Lord, and
    to go to Tarshish. He went down to Joppa and found a ship bound for
    Tarshish; he paid his fare and went aboard, to go with them to Tarshish, to
    get away from the Lord. &nbsp;But the Lord unleashed a violent wind on the
    sea, and there was such a great storm at sea that the ship threatened to
    break up. &nbsp;The sailors took fright, and each of them called on his own
    god, and to lighten the ship they threw the cargo overboard. Jonah, however,
    had gone below and lain down in the hold and fallen fast asleep. &nbsp;The
    boatswain came upon him and said, 'What do you mean by sleeping? Get up!
    Call on your god! Perhaps he will spare us a thought, and not leave us to
    die.' &nbsp;Then they said to each other, 'Come on, let us draw lots to find
    out who is responsible for bringing this evil on us'. So they cast lots, and
    the lot fell to Jonah. &nbsp;Then they said to him, 'Tell us, what is your
    business? Where do you come from? What is your country? What is your
    nationality?' &nbsp;He replied, 'I am a Hebrew, and I worship the Lord, the
    God of heaven, who made the sea and the land'. &nbsp;The sailors were seized
    with terror at this and said, 'What have you done?' They knew that he was
    trying to escape from the Lord, because he had told them so. &nbsp;They then
    said, 'What are we to do with you, to make the sea grow calm for us?' For
    the sea was growing rougher and rougher. &nbsp;He replied, 'Take me and
    throw me into the sea, and then it will grow calm for you. For I can see it
    is my fault this violent storm has happened to you.' &nbsp;The sailors rowed
    hard in an effort to reach the shore, but in vain, since the sea grew still
    rougher for them. &nbsp;They then called on the Lord and said, 'O Lord, do
    not let us perish for taking this man's life; do not hold us guilty of
    innocent blood; for you, Lord, have acted as you have thought
    right'.&nbsp;And taking hold of Jonah they threw him into the sea; and the
    sea grew calm again. &nbsp;At this the men were seized with dread of Yahweh;
    they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows. &nbsp;The Lord had
    arranged that a great fish should be there to swallow Jonah, and Jonah
    remained in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights. &nbsp;The
    Lord spoke to the fish, which then vomited Jonah on to the shore.

    I am astonished at the promptness with which you have turned away from the
    one who called you and have decided to follow a different version of the
    Good News. &nbsp;Not that there can be more than one Good News; it is merely
    that some troublemakers among you want to change the Good News of Christ;
    &nbsp;and let me warn you that if anyone preaches a version of the Good News
    different from the one we have already preached to you, whether it be
    ourselves or an angel from heaven, he is to be condemned. &nbsp;I am only
    repeating what we told you before: if anyone preaches a version of the Good
    News different from the one you have already heard, he is to be condemned.
    &nbsp;So now whom am I trying to please - man, or God? Would you say it is
    men's approval I am looking for? If I still wanted that, I should not be
    what I am - a servant of Christ. &nbsp;The fact is, brothers, and I want you
    to realise this, the Good News I preached is not a human message &nbsp;that
    I was given by men, it is something I learnt only through a revelation of
    Jesus Christ.

    There was a lawyer who, to disconcert Jesus, stood up and said to him,
    'Master, what must I do to inherit eternal life?' &nbsp;He said to him,
    'What is written in the Law? What do you read there?' &nbsp;He replied, 'You
    must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with
    all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbour as yourself'.
    &nbsp;'You have answered right,' said Jesus 'do this and life is yours.'
    &nbsp;But the man was anxious to justify himself and said to Jesus, 'And who
    is my neighbour?' &nbsp;Jesus replied, 'A man was once on his way down from
    Jerusalem to Jericho and fell into the hands of brigands; they took all he
    had, beat him and then made off, leaving him half dead. &nbsp;Now a priest
    happened to be traveling down the same road, but when he saw the man, he
    passed by on the other side. &nbsp;In the same way a Levite who came to the
    place saw him, and passed by on the other side. &nbsp;But a Samaritan
    traveler who came upon him was moved with compassion when he saw him.
    &nbsp;He went up and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. He
    then lifted him on to his own mount, carried him to the inn and looked after
    him. &nbsp;Next day, he took out two denarii and handed them to the
    innkeeper. "Look after him," he said "and on my way back I will make good
    any extra expense you have." &nbsp;Which of these three, do you think,
    proved himself a neighbour to the man who fell into the brigands` hands?'
    &nbsp;'The one who took pity on him' he replied. Jesus said to him, 'Go, and
    do the same yourself'.

    The word of the Lord was addressed a second time to Jonah: &nbsp;'Up!' he
    said 'Go to Nineveh, the great city, and preach to them as I told you to.'
    &nbsp;Jonah set out and went to Nineveh in obedience to the word of the
    Lord. Now Nineveh was a city great beyond compare: it took three days to
    cross it. &nbsp;Jonah went on into the city, making a day's journey. He
    preached in these words, 'Only forty days more and Nineveh is going to be
    destroyed'. &nbsp;And the people of Nineveh believed in God; they proclaimed
    a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least. &nbsp;The news
    reached the king of Nineveh, who rose from his throne, took off his robe,
    put on sackcloth and sat down in ashes. &nbsp;A proclamation was then
    promulgated throughout Nineveh, by decree of the king and his ministers, as
    follows: 'Men and beasts, herds and flocks, are to taste nothing; they must
    not eat, they must not drink water. &nbsp;All are to put on sackcloth and
    call on God with all their might and let everyone renounce his evil
    behaviour and the wicked things he has done. &nbsp;Who knows if God will not
    change his mind and relent, if he will not renounce his burning wrath, so
    that we do not perish?' &nbsp;God saw their efforts to renounce their evil
    behaviour. And God relented: he did not inflict on them the disaster which
    he had threatened.

    You must have heard of my career as a practising Jew, how merciless I was in
    persecuting the Church of God, how much damage I did to it, &nbsp;how I
    stood out among other Jews of my generation, and how enthusiastic I was for
    the traditions of my ancestors. &nbsp;Then God, who had specially chosen me
    while I was still in my mother's womb, called me through his grace and chose
    &nbsp;to reveal his Son in me, so that I might preach the Good News about
    him to the pagans. I did not stop to discuss this with any human being,
    &nbsp;nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were already apostles
    before me, but I went off to Arabia at once and later went straight back
    from there to Damascus. &nbsp;Even when after three years I went up to
    Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him for fifteen days, &nbsp;I did
    not see any of the other apostles; I only saw James, the brother of the
    Lord, &nbsp;and I swear before God that what I have just written is the
    literal truth. &nbsp;After that I went to Syria and Cilicia, &nbsp;and was
    still not known by sight to the churches of Christ in Judaea, &nbsp;who had
    heard nothing except that their one-time persecutor was now preaching the
    faith he had previously tried to destroy; &nbsp;and they gave glory to God
    for me.

    Jonah was very indignant at this; he fell into a rage. &nbsp;He prayed to
    the Lord and said, 'Ah! Lord, is not this just as I said would happen when I
    was still at home? That was why I went and lied to Tarshish: I knew that you
    were a God of tenderness and compassion, slow to anger, rich in
    graciousness, relenting from evil. &nbsp;So now Lord, please take away my
    life, for I might as well be dead as go on living.' &nbsp;The Lord replied,
    'Are you right to be angry?'&nbsp;Jonah then went out of the city and sat
    down to the east of the city. There he made himself a shelter and sat under
    it in the shade, to see what would happen to the city. &nbsp;Then the Lord
    God arranged that a castor-oil plant should grow up over Jonah to give shade
    for his head and soothe his ill-humour; Jonah was delighted with the
    castor-oil plant. &nbsp;But at dawn the next day, God arranged that a worm
    should attack the castor-oil plant - and it withered. &nbsp;Next, when the
    sun rose, God arranged that there should be a scorching east wind; the sun
    beat down so hard on Jonah's head that he was overcome and begged for death,
    saying, 'I might as well be dead as go on living'. &nbsp;God said to Jonah,
    'Are you right to be angry about the castor-oil plant?' He replied, 'I have
    every right to be angry, to the point of death'. &nbsp;The Lord replied,
    'You are only upset about a castor-oil plant which cost you no labour, which
    you did not make grow, which sprouted in a night and has perished in a
    night. &nbsp;And am I not to feel sorry for Nineveh, the great city, in
    which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot
    tell their right hand from their left, to say nothing of all the animals?'

  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    It was not till fourteen years had passed that I went up to Jerusalem again.
    I went with Barnabas and took Titus with me. &nbsp;I went there as the
    result of a revelation, and privately I laid before the leading men the Good
    News as I proclaim it among the pagans; I did so for fear the course I was
    adopting or had already adopted would not be allowed. &nbsp;On the contrary,
    they recognised that I had been commissioned to preach the Good News to the
    uncircumcised just as Peter had been commissioned to preach it to the
    circumcised. &nbsp;The same person whose action had made Peter the apostle
    of the circumcised had given me a similar mission to the pagans. &nbsp;So,
    James, Cephas and John, these leaders, these pillars, shook hands with
    Barnabas and me as a sign of partnership: we were to go to the pagans and
    they to the circumcised. &nbsp;The only thing they insisted on was that we
    should remember to help the poor, as indeed I was anxious to do. &nbsp;When
    Cephas came to Antioch, however, I opposed him to his face, since he was
    manifestly in the wrong. &nbsp;His custom had been to eat with the pagans,
    but after certain friends of James arrived he stopped doing this and kept
    away from them altogether for fear of the group that insisted on
    circumcision. &nbsp;The other Jews joined him in this pretence, and even
    Barnabas felt himself obliged to copy their behaviour. &nbsp;When I saw they
    were not respecting the true meaning of the Good News, I said to Cephas in
    front of everyone, 'In spite of being a Jew, you live like the pagans and
    not like the Jews, so you have no right to make the pagans copy Jewish
    ways'.

    You say harsh things about me, says the Lord. You ask, 'What have we said
    against you?' &nbsp;You say, 'It is useless to serve God; what is the good
    of keeping his commands or of walking mournfully before the Lord of hosts?
    &nbsp;Now we have reached the point when we call the arrogant blessed; yes,
    they prosper, these evil-doers; they try God's patience and yet go free.'
    &nbsp;This is what those who fear the Lord used to say to one another. But
    the Lord took note and heard them: a book of remembrance was written in his
    presence recording those who fear him and take refuge in his name. &nbsp;On
    the day which I am preparing, says the Lord of hosts, they are going to be
    my own special possession. I will make allowances for them as a man makes
    allowances for the son who obeys him. &nbsp;Then once again you will see the
    difference between an upright man and a wicked one, between the one who
    serves God and the one who does not serve him. &nbsp;For the day is coming
    now, burning like a furnace; and all the arrogant and the evil-doers will be
    like stubble. The day that is coming is going to burn them up, says the Lord
    of hosts, leaving them neither root nor stalk. &nbsp;But for you who fear my

    Are you people in Galatia mad? Has someone put a spell on you, in spite of

    &nbsp;Let me ask you one question: was it because you practised the Law that

    &nbsp;Are you foolish enough to end in outward observances what you began in

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'Suppose one of you has a friend and goes to
    him in the middle of the night to say, "My friend, lend me three loaves,
    &nbsp;because a friend of mine on his travels has just arrived at my house
    and I have nothing to offer him"; &nbsp;and the man answers from inside the
    house, "Do not bother me. The door is bolted now, and my children and I are
    in bed; I cannot get up to give it you". &nbsp;I tell you, if the man does
    not get up and give it him for friendship's sake, persistence will be enough
    to make him get up and give his friend all he wants. &nbsp;'So I say to you:
    Ask, and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock, and the
    door will be opened to you. &nbsp;For the one who asks always receives; the
    one who searches always finds; the one who knocks will always have the door
    opened to him. &nbsp;What father among you would hand his son a stone when
    he asked for bread? Or hand him a snake instead of a fish? &nbsp;Or hand him
    a scorpion if he asked for an egg? &nbsp;If you then, who are evil, know how
    to give your children what is good, how much more will the heavenly Father
    give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!'

    Don't you see that it is those who rely on faith who are the sons of
    Abraham? &nbsp;Scripture foresaw that God was going to use faith to justify
    the pagans, and proclaimed the Good News long ago when Abraham was told: In
    you all the pagans will be blessed. &nbsp;Those therefore who rely on faith
    receive the same blessing as Abraham, the man of faith. &nbsp;On the other
    hand, those who rely on the keeping of the Law are under a curse, since
    scripture says: Cursed be everyone who does not persevere in observing
    everything prescribed in the book of the Law. &nbsp;The Law will not justify
    anyone in the sight of God, because we are told: the righteous man finds
    life through faith. &nbsp;The Law is not even based on faith, since we are
    told: The man who practises these precepts finds life through practising
    them. &nbsp;Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law by being cursed for
    our sake, since scripture says: Cursed be everyone who is hanged on a tree.
    &nbsp;This was done so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might
    include the pagans, and so that through faith we might receive the promised

    When Jesus had cast out a devil, some of the people said, 'It is through
    Beelzebul, the prince of devils, that he casts out devils'. &nbsp;Others
    asked him, as a test, for a sign from heaven; &nbsp;but, knowing what they
    were thinking, he said to them, 'Every kingdom divided against itself is
    heading for ruin, and a household divided against itself collapses. &nbsp;So
    too with Satan: if he is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand?
    - Since you assert that it is through Beelzebul that I cast out devils.
    &nbsp;Now if it is through Beelzebul that I cast out devils, through whom do
    your own experts cast them out? Let them be your judges then. &nbsp;But if
    it is through the finger of God that I cast out devils, then know that the
    kingdom of God has overtaken you. &nbsp;So long as a strong man fully armed
    guards his own palace, his goods are undisturbed; &nbsp;but when someone
    stronger than he is attacks and defeats him, the stronger man takes away all
    the weapons he relied on and shares out his spoil. &nbsp;'He who is not with
    me is against me; and he who does not gather with me scatters. &nbsp;'When
    an unclean spirit goes out of a man it wanders through waterless country
    looking for a place to rest, and not finding one it says, "I will go back to
    the home I came from". &nbsp;But on arrival, finding it swept and tidied,
    &nbsp;it then goes off and brings seven other spirits more wicked than
    itself, and they go in and set up house there, so that the man ends up by
    being worse than he was before.'

    Scripture makes no exceptions when it says that sin is master everywhere. In
    this way the promise can only be given through faith in Jesus Christ and can
    only be given to those who have this faith. &nbsp;Before faith came, we were
    allowed no freedom by the Law; we were being looked after till faith was
    revealed. &nbsp;The Law was to be our guardian until the Christ came and we
    could be justified by faith. &nbsp;Now that that time has come we are no
    longer under that guardian, &nbsp;and you are, all of you, sons of God
    through faith in Christ Jesus. &nbsp;All baptised in Christ, you have all
    clothed yourselves in Christ, &nbsp;and there are no more distinctions
    between Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female, but all of you are
    one in Christ Jesus. &nbsp;Merely by belonging to Christ you are the
    posterity of Abraham, the heirs he was promised.
