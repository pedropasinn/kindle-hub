    The whole community remained faithful to the teaching of the apostles, to
    the brotherhood, to the breaking of bread and to the prayers. The many
    miracles and signs worked through the apostles made a deep impression on
    everyone. The faithful all lived together and owned everything in common;
    they sold their goods and possessions and shared out the proceeds among
    themselves according to what each one needed. They went as a body to the
    Temple every day but met in their houses for the breaking of bread; they
    shared their food gladly and generously; they praised God and were looked up
    to by everyone. Day by day the Lord added to their community those destined
    to be saved.

    Blessed be God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who in his great mercy
    has given us a new birth as his sons, by raising Jesus Christ from the dead,
    so that we have a sure hope and the promise of an inheritance that can never
    be spoilt or soiled and never fade away, because it is being kept for you in
    the heavens. Through your faith, God's power will guard you until the
    salvation which has been prepared is revealed at the end of time. This is a
    cause of great joy for you, even though you may for a short time have to
    bear being plagued by all sorts of trials; so that, when Jesus Christ is
    revealed, your faith will have been tested and proved like gold - only it is
    more precious than gold, which is corruptible even though it bears testing
    by fire - and then you will have praise and glory and honour. You did not
    see him, yet you love him; and still without seeing him, you are already
    filled with a joy so glorious that it cannot be described, because you
    believe; and you are sure of the end to which your faith looks forward, that
    is, the salvation of your souls.

    Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten by God; and

    can be sure that we love God's children if we love God himself and do what
    he has commanded us; this is what loving God is - keeping his commandments;
    and his commandments are not difficult, because anyone who has been begotten
    by God has already overcome the world; this is the victory over the
    world-our faith. Who can overcome the world? Only the man who believes that
    Jesus is the Son of God: Jesus Christ who came by water and blood, not with
    water only, but with water and blood; with the Spirit as another

    So many signs and wonders were worked among the people at the hands of the
    apostles. The faithful all used to meet by common consent in the Portico of
    Solomon. No one else ever dared to join them, but the people were loud in
    their praise and the numbers of men and women who came to believe in the
    Lord increased steadily, so that the sick were even taken out into the
    streets and laid on beds and sleeping-mats in the hope that at least the
    shadow of Peter might fall across some of them as he went past. People even
    came crowding in from the towns round about Jerusalem, bringing with them
    their sick and those tormented by unclean spirits, and all of them were
    cured.

    My name is John, and through our union in Jesus I am your brother and share
    your sufferings, your kingdom, and all you endure. I was on the island of
    Patmos for having preached God's word and witnessed for Jesus; it was the
    Lord's day and the Spirit possessed me, and I heard a voice behind me,
    shouting like a trumpet, 'Write down all that you see in a book, and send it
    to the seven churches of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis,
    Philadelphia and Laodicea'. I turned round to see who had spoken to me, and
    when I turned I saw seven golden lamp-stands and, surrounded by them, a
    figure like a Son of man, dressed in a long robe tied at the waist with a
    golden girdle. When I saw him, I fell in a dead faint at his feet, but he
    touched me with his right hand and said, 'Do not be afraid; it is I, the
    First and the Last; I am the Living One, I was dead and now I am to live for
    ever and ever, and I hold the keys of death and of the underworld. Now write
    down all that you see of present happenings and things that are still to

    In the evening of that same day, the first day of the week, the doors were
    closed in the room where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews. Jesus
    came and stood among them. He said to them, 'Peace be with you', and showed
    them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when they
    saw the Lord, and he said to them again, 'Peace be with you. 'As the Father
    sent me, so am I sending you.' After saying this he breathed on them and
    said: 'Receive the Holy Spirit. For those whose sins you forgive, they are
    forgiven; for those whose sins you retain, they are retained.' Thomas,
    called the Twin, who was one of the Twelve, was not with them when Jesus
    came. When the disciples said, 'We have seen the Lord', he answered, 'Unless
    I see the holes that the nails made in his hands and can put my finger into
    the holes they made, and unless I can put my hand into his side, I refuse to
    believe'. Eight days later the disciples were in the house again and Thomas
    was with them. The doors were closed, but Jesus came in and stood among
    them. 'Peace be with you' he said. Then he spoke to Thomas, 'Put your finger
    here; look, here are my hands. Give me your hand; put it into my side. Doubt
    no longer but believe.' Thomas replied, 'My Lord and my God!' Jesus said to
    him: 'You believe because you can see me. Happy are those who have not seen
    and yet believe.' There were many other signs that Jesus worked and the
    disciples saw, but they are not recorded in this book. These are recorded so
    that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that
    believing this you may have life through his name.

    As soon as Peter and John were released they went to the community and told
    them everything the chief priests and elders had said to them. When they
    heard it they lifted up their voice to God all together. 'Master,' they
    prayed 'it is you who made heaven and earth and sea, and everything in them;
    you it is who said through the Holy Spirit and speaking through our ancestor
    David, your servant: Why this arrogance among the nations, these futile
    plots among the peoples? Kings on earth setting out to war, princes making
    an alliance, against the Lord and against his Anointed. 'This is what has
    come true: in this very city Herod and Pontius Pilate made an alliance with
    the pagan nations and the peoples of Israel, against your holy servant Jesus
    whom you anointed, but only to bring about the very thing that you in your
    strength and your wisdom had predetermined should happen. And now, Lord,
    take note of their threats and help your servants to proclaim your message
    with all boldness, by stretching out your hand to heal and to work miracles
    and marvels through the name of your holy servant Jesus.' As they prayed,
    the house where they were assembled rocked; they were all filled with the
    Holy Spirit and began to proclaim the word of God boldly.

    There was one of the Pharisees called Nicodemus, a leading Jew, who came to
    Jesus by night and said, 'Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who comes
    from God; for no one could perform the signs that you do unless God were
    with him'. Jesus answered: 'I tell you most solemnly, unless a man is born
    from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God'. Nicodemus said, 'How can a
    grown man be born? Can he go back into his mother's womb and be born again?'
    Jesus replied: 'I tell you most solemnly, unless a man is born through water
    and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God: what is born of the
    flesh is flesh; what is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not be surprised
    when I say: You must be born from above. The wind blows wherever it pleases;
    you hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is
    going. That is how it is with all who are born of the Spirit.'

    Jesus said to Nicodemus: 'You must be born from above. The wind blows
    wherever it pleases; you hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes
    from or where it is going. That is how it is with all who are born of the
    Spirit.' 'How can that be possible?' asked Nicodemus. 'You, a teacher in
    Israel, and you do not know these things!' replied Jesus. 'I tell you most
    solemnly, we speak only about what we know and witness only to what we have
    seen and yet you people reject our evidence. If you do not believe me when I
    speak about things in this world, how are you going to believe me when I
    speak to you about heavenly things? No one has gone up to heaven except the
    one who came down from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven; and the Son
    of Man must be lifted up as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so
    that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him.'

    The high priest intervened with all his supporters from the party of the
    Sadducees. Prompted by jealousy, they arrested the apostles and had them put
    in the common gaol. But at night the angel of the Lord opened the prison
    gates and said as he led them out, 'Go and stand in the Temple, and tell the
    people all about this new Life'. They did as they were told; they went into
    the Temple at dawn and began to preach. When the high priest arrived, he and
    his supporters convened the Sanhedrin - this was the full Senate of Israel -
    and sent to the gaol for them to be brought. But when the officials arrived
    at the prison they found they were not inside, so they went back and
    reported, 'We found the gaol securely locked and the warders on duty at the
    gates, but when we unlocked the door we found no one inside'. When the
    captain of the Temple and the chief priests heard this news they wondered
    what this could mean. Then a man arrived with fresh news. 'At this very
    moment' he said 'the men you imprisoned are in the Temple. They are standing
    there preaching to the people.' The captain went with his men and fetched
    them. They were afraid to use force in case the people stoned them.

    God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who
    believes in him may not be lost but may have eternal life. For God sent his
    Son into the world not to condemn the world, but so that through him the
    world might be saved. No one who believes in him will be condemned; but
    whoever refuses to believe is condemned already, because he has refused to
    believe in the name of God's only Son. On these grounds is sentence
    pronounced: that though the light has come into the world men have shown
    they prefer darkness to the light because their deeds were evil. And indeed,
    everybody who does wrong hates the light and avoids it, for fear his actions
    should be exposed; but the man who lives by the truth comes out into the
    light, so that it may be plainly seen that what he does is done in God.

    When the officials had brought the apostles in to face the Sanhedrin, the
    high priest demanded an explanation. 'We gave you a formal warning' he said
    'not to preach in this name, and what have you done? You have filled
    Jerusalem with your teaching, and seem determined to fix the guilt of this
    man's death on us.' In reply Peter and the apostles said, 'Obedience to God
    comes before obedience to men; it was the God of our ancestors who raised up
    Jesus, but it was you who had him executed by hanging on a tree. By his own
    right hand God has now raised him up to be leader and saviour, to give
    repentance and forgiveness of sins through him to Israel. We are witnesses
    to all this, we and the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey
    him.' This so infuriated them that they wanted to put them to death.

    John the Baptist said to his disciples: 'He who comes from above is above

    earthly way. He who comes from heaven bears witness to the things he has
    seen and heard, even if his testimony is not accepted; though all who do
    accept his testimony are attesting the truthfulness of God, since he whom
    God has sent speaks God's own words: God gives him the Spirit without
    reserve. The Father loves the Son and has entrusted everything to him.
    Anyone who believes in the Son has eternal life, but anyone who refuses to
    believe in the Son will never see life: the anger of God stays on him.'

    One member of the Sanhedrin, a Pharisee called Gamaliel, who was a doctor of
    the Law and respected by the whole people, stood up and asked to have the
    men taken outside for a time. Then he addressed the Sanhedrin, 'Men of
    Israel, be careful how you deal with these people. There was Theudas who
    became notorious not so long ago. He claimed to be someone important, and he
    even collected about four hundred followers; but when he was killed, all his
    followers scattered and that was the end of them. And then there was Judas
    the Galilean, at the time of the census, who attracted crowds of supporters;
    but he got killed too, and all his followers dispersed. What I suggest,
    therefore, is that you leave these men alone and let them go. If this
    enterprise, this movement of theirs, is of human origin it will break up of
    its own accord; but if it does in fact come from God you will not only be
    unable to destroy them, but you might find yourselves fighting against God.'
    His advice was accepted; and they had the apostles called in, gave orders
    for them to be flogged, warned them not to speak in the name of Jesus and
    released them. And so they left the presence of the Sanhedrin glad to have
    had the honour of suffering humiliation for the sake of the name. They
    preached every day both in the Temple and in private houses, and their
    proclamation of the Good News of Christ Jesus was never interrupted.

    Jesus went off to the other side of the Sea of Galilee - or of Tiberias -
    and a large crowd followed him, impressed by the signs he had done in curing
    the sick. Jesus climbed the hillside and sat down there with his disciples.
    The time of the Jewish Passover was near. Looking up, Jesus saw the crowds
    approaching and said to Philip, 'Where can we buy some bread for these
    people to eat?' He said this only to put Philip to the test; he himself knew
    exactly what he was going to do. Philip answered, 'Two hundred denarii would
    not buy enough to give them a little piece each.' One of his disciples,
    Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said, 'Here is a small boy with five barley
    loaves and two fish; but what is that among so many?' Jesus said to them,
    'Make the people sit down.' There was plenty of grass there, and as many as
    five thousand men sat down. Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and
    distributed them to those who were sitting there; he then did the same with
    the fish, distributing as much as they wanted. When they had eaten enough he
    said to the disciples, 'Pick up the pieces left over, so that nothing is
    wasted.' So they picked them up and filled twelve large baskets with scraps
    left over from the meal of five barley loaves. Seeing the sign that he had
    done, the people said, 'This is indeed the prophet who is to come into the
    world.' Jesus, as he realised they were about to come and take him by force
    and make him king, fled back to the hills alone.

    About this time, when the number of disciples was increasing, the Hellenists
    made a complaint against the Hebrews: in the daily distribution their own
    widows were being overlooked. So the Twelve called a full meeting of the
    disciples and addressed them, 'It would not be right for us to neglect the
    word of God so as to give out food; you, brothers, must select from among
    yourselves seven men of good reputation, filled with the Spirit and with
    wisdom; we will hand over this duty to them, and continue to devote
    ourselves to prayer and to the service of the word'. The whole assembly
    approved of this proposal and elected Stephen, a man full of faith and of
    the Holy Spirit, together with Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas,
    and Nicolaus of Antioch, a convert to Judaism. They presented these to the
    apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them. The word of the Lord
    continued to spread: the number of disciples in Jerusalem was greatly
    increased, and a large group of priests made their submission to the faith.

    In the evening the disciples went down to the shore of the lake and got into
    a boat to make for Capernaum on the other side of the lake. It was getting
    dark by now and Jesus had still not rejoined them. The wind was strong, and
    the sea was getting rough. They had rowed three or four miles when they saw
    Jesus walking on the lake and coming towards the boat. This frightened them,
    but he said, 'It is I. Do not be afraid.' They were for taking him into the
    boat, but in no time it reached the shore at the place they were making for.
