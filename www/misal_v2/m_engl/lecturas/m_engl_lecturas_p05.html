    About this time, when the number of disciples was increasing, the Hellenists
    made a complaint against the Hebrews: in the daily distribution their own
    widows were being overlooked. So the Twelve called a full meeting of the
    disciples and addressed them, 'It would not be right for us to neglect the
    word of God so as to give out food; you, brothers, must select from among
    yourselves seven men of good reputation, filled with the Spirit and with
    wisdom; we will hand over this duty to them, and continue to devote
    ourselves to prayer and to the service of the word'. The whole assembly
    approved of this proposal and elected Stephen, a man full of faith and of
    the Holy Spirit, together with Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas,
    and Nicolaus of Antioch, a convert to Judaism. They presented these to the
    apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them. The word of the Lord
    continued to spread: the number of disciples in Jerusalem was greatly
    increased, and a large group of priests made their submission to the faith.

    The Lord is the living stone, rejected by men but chosen by God and precious
    to him; set yourselves close to him so that you too, the holy priesthood
    that offers the spiritual sacrifices which Jesus Christ has made acceptable
    to God, may be living stones making a spiritual house. As scripture says:
    See how I lay in Zion a precious cornerstone that I have chosen and the man
    who rests his trust on it will not be disappointed. That means that for you
    who are believers, it is precious; but for unbelievers, the stone rejected
    by the builders has proved to be the keystone, a stone to stumble over, a
    rock to bring men down. They stumble over it because they do not believe in
    the word; it was the fate in store for them. But you are a chosen race, a
    royal priesthood, a consecrated nation, a people set apart to sing the
    praises of God who called you out of the darkness into his wonderful light.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in
    God still, and trust in me. There are many rooms in my Father's house; if
    there were not, I should have told you. I am going now to prepare a place
    for you, and after I have gone and prepared you a place, I shall return to
    take you with me; so that where I am you may be too. You know the way to the
    place where I am going.' Thomas said, 'Lord, we do not know where you are
    going, so how can we know the way?' Jesus said: 'I am the Way, the Truth and
    the Life. No one can come to the Father except through me. If you know me,
    you know my Father too. From this moment you know him and have seen him.'
    Philip said, 'Lord, let us see the Father and then we shall be satisfied'.
    'Have I been with you all this time, Philip,' said Jesus to him 'and you
    still do not know me? 'To have seen me is to have seen the Father, so how
    can you say, "Let us see the Father"? Do you not believe that I am in the
    Father and the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak as
    from myself: it is the Father, living in me, who is doing this work. You
    must believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me;
    believe it on the evidence of this work, if for no other reason. I tell you
    most solemnly, whoever believes in me will perform the same works as I do
    myself, he will perform even greater works, because I am going to the
    Father.'

    When Saul got to Jerusalem he tried to join the disciples, but they were all
    afraid of him: they could not believe he was really a disciple. Barnabas,
    however, took charge of him, introduced him to the apostles, and explained
    how the Lord had appeared to Saul and spoken to him on his journey, and how
    he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus. Saul now started to
    go round with them in Jerusalem, preaching fearlessly in the name of the
    Lord. But after he had spoken to the Hellenists, and argued with them, they
    became determined to kill him. When the brothers knew, they took him to
    Caesarea, and sent him off from there to Tarsus. The churches throughout
    Judaea, Galilee and Samaria were now left in peace, building themselves up,
    living in the fear of the Lord, and filled with the consolation of the Holy
    Spirit.

    My children, our love is not to be just words or mere talk, but something
    real and active; only by this can we be certain that we are children of the
    truth and be able to quieten our conscience in his presence, whatever
    accusations it may raise against us, because God is greater than our
    conscience and he knows everything. My dear people, if we cannot be
    condemned by our own conscience, we need not be afraid in God's presence,
    and whatever we ask him, we shall receive, because we keep his commandments
    and live the kind of life that he wants. His commandments are these: that we
    believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and that we love one another as
    he told us to. Whoever keeps his commandments lives in God and God lives in
    him. We know that he lives in us by the Spirit that he has given us.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'I am the true vine, and my Father is the
    vinedresser. Every branch in me that bears no fruit he cuts away, and every
    branch that does bear fruit he prunes to make it bear even more. You are
    pruned already, by means of the word that I have spoken to you. Make your
    home in me, as I make mine in you. As a branch cannot bear fruit all by
    itself, but must remain part of the vine, neither can you unless you remain
    in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me, with me
    in him, bears fruit in plenty; for cut off from me you can do nothing.
    Anyone who does not remain in me is like a branch that has been thrown away
    - he withers; these branches are collected and thrown on the fire, and they
    are burnt. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, you may ask what
    you will and you shall get it. It is to the glory of my Father that you
    should bear much fruit, and then you will be my disciples.'

    Paul and Barnabas went back through Lystra and Iconium to Antioch. They put
    fresh heart into the disciples, encouraging them to persevere in the faith.
    'We all have to experience many hardships' they said 'before we enter the
    kingdom of God.' In each of these churches they appointed elders, and with
    prayer and fasting they commended them to the Lord in whom they had come to
    believe. They passed through Pisidia and reached Pamphylia. Then after
    proclaiming the word at Perga they went down to Attalia and from there
    sailed for Antioch, where they had originally been commended to the grace of
    God for the work they had now completed. On their arrival they assembled the
    church and gave an account of all that God had done with them, and how he
    had opened the door of faith to the pagans.

    With the connivance of the authorities a move was made by pagans as well as
    Jews to make attacks on Paul and Barnabas and to stone them. When the
    apostles came to hear of this, they went off for safety to Lycaonia where,
    in the towns of Lystra and Derbe and in the surrounding country, they
    preached the Good News. A man sat there who had never walked in his life,
    because his feet were crippled from birth; and as he listened to Paul
    preaching, he managed to catch his eye. Seeing that the man had the faith to
    be cured, Paul said in a loud voice, 'Get to your feet - stand up', and the
    cripple jumped up and began to walk. When the crowd saw what Paul had done
    they shouted in the language of Lycaonia, 'These people are gods who have
    come down to us disguised as men'. They addressed Barnabas as Zeus, and
    since Paul was the principal speaker they called him Hermes. The priests of
    Zeus-outside-the-Gate, proposing that all the people should offer sacrifice
    with them, brought garlanded oxen to the gates. When the apostles Barnabas
    and Paul heard what was happening they tore their clothes, and rushed into
    the crowd, shouting, 'Friends, what do you think you are doing? We are only
    human beings like you. We have come with good news to make you turn from
    these empty idols to the living God who made heaven and earth and the sea
    and all that these hold.&nbsp; In the past he allowed each nation to go its
    own way; but even then he did not leave you without evidence of himself in
    the good things he does for you: he sends you rain from heaven, he makes
    your crops grow when they should, he gives you food and makes you happy.'
    Even this speech, however, was scarcely enough to stop the crowd offering
    them sacrifice.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'Anybody who receives my commandments and keeps
    them will be one who loves me; and anybody who loves me will be loved by my
    Father, and I shall love him and show myself to him.' Judas - this was not
    Judas Iscariot - said to him, 'Lord, what is all this about? Do you intend
    to show yourself to us and not to the world?' Jesus replied: 'If anyone
    loves me he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we shall
    come to him and make our home with him. Those who do not love me do not keep
    my words. And my word is not my own: it is the word of the one who sent me.
    I have said these things to you while still with you; but the Advocate, the
    Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything
    and remind you of all I have said to you.'

    Some Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium, and turned the people against
    the apostles. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the town, thinking he
    was dead. The disciples came crowding round him but, as they did so, he
    stood up and went back to the town. The next day he and Barnabas went off to
    Derbe. Having preached the Good News in that town and made a considerable
    number of disciples, they went back through Lystra and Iconium to Antioch.
    They put fresh heart into the disciples, encouraging them to persevere in
    the faith. 'We all have to experience many hardships' they said 'before we
    enter the kingdom of God.' In each of these churches they appointed elders,
    and with prayer and fasting they commended them to the Lord in whom they had
    come to believe. They passed through Pisidia and reached Pamphylia. Then
    after proclaiming the word at Perga they went down to Attalia and from there
    sailed for Antioch, where they had originally been commended to the grace of
    God for the work they had now completed. On their arrival they assembled the
    church and gave an account of all that God had done with them, and how he
    had opened the door of faith to the pagans. They stayed there with the
    disciples for some time.

    Some men came down from Judaea and taught the brothers, 'Unless you have
    yourselves circumcised in the tradition of Moses you cannot be saved'. This
    led to disagreement, and after Paul and Barnabas had had a long argument
    with these men it was arranged that Paul and Barnabas and others of the
    church should go up to Jerusalem and discuss the problem with the apostles
    and elders. All the members of the church saw them off, and as they passed
    through Phoenicia and Samaria they told how the pagans had been converted,
    and this news was received with the greatest satisfaction by the brothers.
    When they arrived in Jerusalem they were welcomed by the church and by the
    apostles and elders, and gave an account of all that God had done with them.
    But certain members of the Pharisees' party who had become believers
    objected, insisting that the pagans should be circumcised and instructed to
    keep the Law of Moses. The apostles and elders met to look into the matter.

    branch that does bear fruit he prunes to make it bear even more. You are
    pruned already, by means of the word that I have spoken to you. Make your

    itself, but must remain part of the vine, neither can you unless you remain
    in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me, with me
    in him, bears fruit in plenty; for cut off from me you can do nothing.
    Anyone who does not remain in me is like a branch that has been thrown away
    - he withers; these branches are collected and thrown on the fire, and they
    are burnt. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, you may ask what
    you will and you shall get it. It is to the glory of my Father that you
    should bear much fruit, and then you will be my disciples.'

  </p>
  <p>
    After the discussion had gone on a long time, Peter stood up and addressed
    the apostles and elders. 'My brothers,' he said 'you know perfectly well
    that in the early days God made his choice among you: the pagans were to
    learn the Good News from me and so become believers. In fact God, who can
    read everyone's heart, showed his approval of them by giving the Holy Spirit
    to them just as he had to us. God made no distinction between them and us,
    since he purified their hearts by faith. It would only provoke God's anger
    now, surely, if you imposed on the disciples the very burden that neither we
    nor our ancestors were strong enough to support? Remember, we believe that
    we are saved in the same way as they are: through the grace of the Lord
    Jesus.' This silenced the entire assembly, and they listened to Barnabas and
    Paul describing the signs and wonders God had worked through them among the
    pagans. When they had finished it was James who spoke. 'My brothers,' he
    said 'listen to me. Simeon has described how God first arranged to enlist a
    people for his name out of the pagans. This is entirely in harmony with the
    words of the prophets, since the scriptures say: After that I shall return
    and rebuild the fallen House of David; I shall rebuild it from its ruins and
    restore it. Then the rest of mankind, all the pagans who are consecrated to
    my name, will look for the Lord, says the Lord who made this known so long
    ago. 'I rule, then, that instead of making things more difficult for pagans
    who turn to God, we send them a letter telling them merely to abstain from
    anything polluted by idols, from fornication, from the meat of strangled
    animals and from blood. For Moses has always had his preachers in every
    town, and is read aloud in the synagogues every sabbath.'

    The apostles and elders decided to choose delegates to send to Antioch with
    Paul and Barnabas; the whole church concurred with this. They chose Judas
    known as Barsabbas and Silas, both leading men in the brotherhood, and gave
    them this letter to take with them: 'The apostles and elders, your brothers,
    send greetings to the brothers of pagan birth in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia.
    We hear that some of our members have disturbed you with their demands and
    have unsettled your minds. They acted without any authority from us; and so
    we have decided unanimously to elect delegates and to send them to you with
    Barnabas and Paul, men we highly respect who have dedicated their lives to
    the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Accordingly we are sending you Judas and
    Silas, who will confirm by word of mouth what we have written in this
    letter. It has been decided by the Holy Spirit and by ourselves not to
    saddle you with any burden beyond these essentials: you are to abstain from
    food sacrificed to idols; from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and
    from fornication. Avoid these, and you will do what is right. Farewell.' The
    party left and went down to Antioch, where they summoned the whole community
    and delivered the letter. The community read it and were delighted with the
    encouragement it gave them.

    From Cilicia Paul went to Derbe, and then on to Lystra. Here there was a
    disciple called Timothy, whose mother was a Jewess who had become a
    believer; but his father was a Greek. The brothers at Lystra and Iconium
    spoke well of Timothy, and Paul, who wanted to have him as a travelling
    companion, had him circumcised. This was on account of the Jews in the
    locality where everyone knew his father was a Greek. As they visited one
    town after another, they passed on the decisions reached by the apostles and
    elders in Jerusalem, with instructions to respect them. So the churches grew
    strong in the faith, as well as growing daily in numbers. They travelled
    through Phrygia and the Galatian country, having been told by the Holy
    Spirit not to preach the word in Asia. When they reached the frontier of
    Mysia they thought to cross it into Bithynia, but as the Spirit of Jesus
    would not allow them, they went through Mysia and came down to Troas. One
    night Paul had a vision: a Macedonian appeared and appealed to him in these
    words, 'Come across to Macedonia and help us'. Once he had seen this vision
    we lost no time in arranging a passage to Macedonia, convinced that God had

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'If the world hates you, remember that it hated
    me before you. If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as its
    own; but because you do not belong to the world, because my choice withdrew
    you from the world, therefore the world hates you. Remember the words I said
    to you: A servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me,
    they will persecute you too; if they kept my word, they will keep yours as
    well. But it will be on my account that they will do all this, because they
    do not know the one who sent me.'
