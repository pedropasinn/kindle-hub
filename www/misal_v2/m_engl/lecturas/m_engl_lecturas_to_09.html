    God's justice that was made known through the Law and the Prophets has now
    been revealed outside the Law, since it is the same justice of God that
    comes through faith to everyone, Jew and pagan alike, who believes in Jesus
    Christ. Both Jew and pagan sinned and forfeited God's glory, and both are
    justified through the free gift of his grace by being redeemed in Christ
    Jesus who was appointed by God to sacrifice his life so as to win
    reconciliation through faith since, as we see it, a man is justified by
    faith and not by doing something the Law tells him to do.

    Father in heaven. When the day comes many will say to me, "Lord, Lord, did

    It is the same God that said, 'Let there be light shining out of darkness',

    comes from God and not from us. We are in difficulties on all sides, but
    never cornered; we see no answer to our problems, but never despair; we have
    been persecuted, but never deserted; knocked down, but never killed; always,
    wherever we may be, we carry with us in our body the death of Jesus, so that
    the life of Jesus, too, may always be seen in our body. Indeed, while we are
    still alive, we are consigned to our death every day, for the sake of Jesus,

  One sabbath day, Jesus happened to be taking a walk through the cornfields,
  and his disciples began to pick ears of corn as they went along. And the
  Pharisees said to him, 'Look, why are they doing something on the sabbath day
  that is forbidden?' And he replied, 'Did you never read what David did in his
  time of need when he and his followers were hungry - how he went into the
  house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the loaves of offering
  which only the priests are allowed to eat, and how he also gave some to the
  men with him?' And he said to them, 'The sabbath was made for man, not man for
  the sabbath; the Son of Man is master even of the sabbath'. He went again into
  a synagogue, and there was a man there who had a withered hand. And they were
  watching him to see if he would cure him on the sabbath day, hoping for
  something to use against him. He said to the man with the withered hand,
  'Stand up out in the middle!' Then he said to them, 'Is it against the law on
  the sabbath day to do good, or to do evil; to save life, or to kill?' But they
  said nothing. Then, grieved to find them so obstinate, he looked angrily round
  at them, and said to the man, 'Stretch out your hand'. He stretched it out and
  his hand was better. The Pharisees went out and at once began to plot with the
  Herodians against him, discussing how to destroy him.

    to any human being but who has been appointed by Jesus Christ and by God the
    Father who raised Jesus from the dead. I am astonished at the promptness
    with which you have turned away from the one who called you and have decided
    to follow a different version of the Good News. Not that there can be more
    than one Good News; it is merely that some troublemakers among you want to
    change the Good News of Christ; and let me warn you that if anyone preaches
    a version of the Good News different from the one we have already preached
    to you, whether it be ourselves or an angel from heaven, he is to be
    condemned. I am only repeating what we told you before: if anyone preaches a
    version of the Good News different from the one you have already heard, he
    is to be condemned. So now whom am I trying to please - man, or God? Would
    you say it is men's approval I am looking for? If I still wanted that, I

    When Jesus had come to the end of all he wanted the people to hear, he went
    into Capernaum. A centurion there had a servant, a favourite of his, who was
    sick and near death. Having heard about Jesus he sent some Jewish elders to
    him to ask him to come and heal his servant. When they came to Jesus they
    pleaded earnestly with him. 'He deserves this of you' they said 'because he
    is friendly towards our people; in fact, he is the one who built the
    synagogue.' So Jesus went with them, and was not very far from the house
    when the centurion sent word to him by some friends: 'Sir,' he said 'do not
    put yourself to trouble; because I am not worthy to have you under my roof;
    and for this same reason I did not presume to come to you myself; but give
    the word and let my servant be cured. For I am under authority myself, and
    have soldiers under me; and I say to one man: Go, and he goes; to another:
    Come here, and he comes; to my servant: Do this, and he does it.' When Jesus
    heard these words he was astonished at him and, turning round, said to the
    crowd following him, 'I tell you, not even in Israel have I found faith like
    this'. And when the messengers got back to the house they found the servant
    in perfect health.

    I, Tobit, have walked in paths of truth and in good works all the days of my
    life. I have given much in alms to my brothers and fellow countrymen, exiled
    like me to Nineveh in the country of Assyria. At our feast of Pentecost (the
    feast of Weeks) there was a good dinner. I took my place for the meal; the
    table was brought to me and various dishes were brought. Then I said to my
    son Tobias, 'Go, my child, and seek out some poor, loyal-hearted man among
    our brothers exiled in Nineveh, and bring him to share my meal. I will wait
    until you come back, my child.' So Tobias went out to look for some poor man
    among our brothers, but he came back again and said, 'Father!' I answered,
    'What is it, my child?' He went on, 'Father, one of our nation has just been
    murdered; he has been strangled and then thrown down in the market place; he
    is there still'. I sprang up at once, left my meal untouched, took the man
    from the market place and laid him in one of my rooms, waiting until sunset
    to bury him. I came in again and washed myself and ate my bread in sorrow,
    remembering the words of the prophet Amos concerning Bethel: Your feasts
    will be turned to mourning, and all your songs to lamentation. And I wept.
    When the sun was down, I went and dug a grave and buried him. My neighbours
    laughed and said, 'See! He is not afraid any more.' (You must remember that
    a price had been set on my head earlier for this very thing.) 'The time
    before this he had to flee, yet here he is, beginning to bury the dead
    again.'

    you will be able to share the divine nature and to escape corruption in a
    world that is sunk in vice. But to attain this, you will have to do your
    utmost yourselves, adding goodness to the faith that you have, understanding
    to your goodness, self-control to your understanding, patience to your
    self-control, true devotion to your patience, kindness towards your fellow
    men to your devotion, and, to this kindness, love.

    Jesus began to speak to the chief priests, the scribes and the elders in
    parables, 'A man planted a vineyard; he fenced it round, dug out a trough
    for the winepress and built a tower; then he leased it to tenants and went
    abroad. When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from
    them his share of the produce from the vineyard. But they seized the man,
    thrashed him and sent him away empty-handed. Next he sent another servant to
    them; him they beat about the head and treated shamefully. And he sent
    another and him they killed; then a number of others, and they thrashed some
    and killed the rest. He had still someone left: his beloved son. He sent him
    to them last of all. "They will respect my son" he said. But those tenants
    said to each other, "This is the heir. Come on, let us kill him, and the
    inheritance will be ours." So they seized him and killed him and threw him
    out of the vineyard. Now what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will
    come and make an end of the tenants and give the vineyard to others. Have
    you not read this text of scripture: It was the stone rejected by the
    builders that became the keystone. This was the Lord's doing and it is
    wonderful to see? And they would have liked to arrest him, because they
    realized that the parable was aimed at them, but they were afraid of the
    crowds. So they left him alone and went away.

    I, Tobit, took a bath; then I went into the courtyard and lay down by the
    courtyard wall. Since it was hot I left my face uncovered. I did not know
    that there were sparrows in the wall above my head; their hot droppings fell
    into my eyes. White spots then formed, which I was obliged to have treated
    by the doctors. But the more ointments they tried me with, the more the
    spots blinded me, and in the end I became blind altogether. I remained
    without sight four years; all my brothers were distressed; and Ahikar
    provided for my upkeep for two years, till he left for Elymais. My wife Anna
    then undertook woman's work; she would spin wool and take cloth to weave;
    she used to deliver whatever had been ordered from her and then receive
    payment. Now on March the seventh she finished a piece of work and delivered
    it to her customers. They paid her all that was due, and into the bargain
    presented her with a kid for a meal. When the kid came into my house, it
    began to bleat. I called to my wife and said, 'Where does this creature come
    from? Suppose it has been stolen! Quick, let the owners have it back; we
    have no right to eat stolen goods.' She said, 'No, it was a present given me
    over and above my wages.' I did not believe her, and told her to give it
    back to the owners (I blushed at this in her presence). Then she answered,
    'What about your own alms? What about your own good works? Everyone knows
    what return you have had for them.'

    At that time the chief priests and the scribes and the elders sent to Jesus
    some Pharisees and some Herodians to catch him out in what he said. These
    came and said to him, 'Master, we know you are an honest man, that you are
    not afraid of anyone, because a man's rank means nothing to you, and that
    you teach the way of God in all honesty. Is it permissible to pay taxes to
    Caesar or not? Should we pay, yes or no?' Seeing through their hypocrisy he
    said to them, 'Why do you set this trap for me? Hand me a denarius and let
    me see it.' They handed him one and he said, 'Whose head is this? Whose
    name?' 'Caesar's' they told him. Jesus said to them, 'Give back to Caesar
    what belongs to Caesar - and to God what belongs to God'. This reply took
    them completely by surprise.

    Sad at heart, I sighed and wept, and began this prayer of lamentation: 'You
    are just, O Lord, and just are all your works. All your ways are grace and
    truth, and you are the Judge of the world. 'Therefore, Lord, remember me,
    look on me. Do not punish me for my sins or for my heedless faults or for
    those of my fathers. 'For we have sinned against you and broken your
    commandments; and you have given us over to be plundered, to captivity and
    death, to be the talk, the laughing-stock and scorn of all the nations among
    whom you have dispersed us. 'Whereas all your decrees are true when you deal
    with me as my faults deserve, and those of my fathers, since we have neither
    kept your commandments nor walked in truth before you; so now, do with me as
    you will; be pleased to take my life from me; I desire to be delivered from
    earth and to become earth again. For death is better for me than life. I
    have been reviled without a cause and I am distressed beyond measure. 'Lord,
    I wait for the sentence you will give to deliver me from this affliction.
    Let me go away to my everlasting home; do not turn your face from me, O
    Lord. For it is better to die than still to live in the face of trouble that
    knows no pity; I am weary of hearing myself traduced.'3:7 It chanced on the
    same day that Sarah the daughter of Raguel, who lived in Media at Ecbatana,
    also heard insults from one of her father's maids. You must know that she
    had been given in marriage seven times, and that Asmodeus, that worst of
    demons, had killed her bridegrooms one after another before ever they had
    slept with her as man with wife. The servant-girl said, 'Yes, you kill your
    bridegrooms yourself. That makes seven already to whom you have been given,
    and you have not once been in luck yet. Just because your bridegrooms have
    died, that is no reason for punishing us. Go and join them, and may we be
    spared the sight of any child of yours!' That day, she grieved, she sobbed,
    and went up to her father's room intending to hang herself. But then she
    thought, 'Suppose they blamed my father! They will say, "You had an only
    daughter whom you loved, and now she has hanged herself for grief". I cannot
    cause my father a sorrow which would bring down his old age to the dwelling
    of the dead. I should do better not to hang myself, but to beg the Lord to
    let me die and not live to hear any more insults.' This time the prayer of
    each of them found favour before the glory of God, and Raphael was sent to
    bring remedy to them both.

  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    From Paul, appointed by God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus in his design
    to promise life in Christ Jesus; to Timothy, dear child of mine, wishing you
    grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.
    Night and day I thank God, keeping my conscience clear and remembering my
    duty to him as my ancestors did, and always I remember you in my prayers.
    This is why I am reminding you now to fan into a flame the gift that God
    gave you when I laid my hands on you. God's gift was not a spirit of
    timidity, but the Spirit of power, and love, and self-control. So you are
    never to be ashamed of witnessing to the Lord, or ashamed of me for being
    his prisoner; but with me, bear the hardships for the sake of the Good News,
    relying on the power of God who has saved us and called us to be holy - not
    because of anything we ourselves have done but for his own purpose and by
    his own grace. This grace had already been granted to us, in Christ Jesus,
    before the beginning of time, but it has only been revealed by the Appearing
    of our saviour Christ Jesus. He abolished death, and he has proclaimed life
    and immortality through the Good News; and I have been named its herald, its
    apostle and its teacher. It is only on account of this that I am
    experiencing fresh hardships here now ; but I have not lost confidence,
    because I know who it is that I have put my trust in, and I have no doubt at
    all that he is able to take care of all that I have entrusted to him until
    that Day.

    Some Sadducees - who deny that there is a resurrection - came to Jesus and
    they put this question to him: 'Master, we have it from Moses in writing, if
    a man's brother dies leaving a wife but no child, the man must marry the
    widow to raise up children for his brother. Now there were seven brothers.
    The first married a wife and then died leaving no children. The second
    married the widow, and he too died leaving no children; with the third it
    was the same, and none of the seven left any children. Last of all the woman
    herself died. Now at the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will
    she be, since she had been married to all seven?' Jesus said to them, 'Is
    not the reason why you go wrong, that you understand neither the scriptures
    nor the power of God? For when they rise from the dead, men and women do not
    marry; no, they are like the angels in heaven. Now about the dead rising
    again, have you never read in the Book of Moses, in the passage about the
    Bush, how God spoke to him and said: I am the God of Abraham, the God of
    Isaac and the God of Jacob? He is God, not of the dead, but of the living.
    You are very much mistaken.'

    A reading from the Book of Tobit<span class="alindcha">6:10-11; 7:1.9-17; 8:4-9</span>
  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    When the angel Raphael and Tobiah had entered Media and were getting close
    to Ecbatana, Raphael said to the boy, “Tobiah, my brother!” He replied:
    “Here I am!” He said: “Tonight we must stay with Raguel, who is a relative
    of yours. He has a daughter named Sarah.”
  </p>
  <p>
    So he brought him to the house of Raguel, whom they found seated by his
    courtyard gate. They greeted him first. He said to them, “Greetings to you
    too, brothers! Good health to you, and welcome!” And he brought them into
    his home.
  </p>
  <p>
    Raguel slaughtered a ram from the flock and gave them a cordial reception.
    When they had bathed and reclined to eat, Tobiah said to Raphael, “Brother
    Azariah, ask Raguel to let me marry my kinswoman Sarah.” Raguel overheard
    the words; so he said to the boy: “Eat and drink and be merry tonight, for
    no man is more entitled to marry my daughter Sarah than you, brother.
    Besides, not even I have the right to give her to anyone but you, because
    you are my closest relative. But I will explain the situation to you very
    frankly. I have given her in marriage to seven men, all of whom were kinsmen
    of ours, and all died on the very night they approached her. But now, son,
    eat and drink. I am sure the Lord will look after you both.” Tobiah
    answered, “I will eat or drink nothing until you set aside what belongs to
    me.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Raguel said to him: “I will do it. She is yours according to the decree of
    the Book of Moses. Your marriage to her has been decided in heaven! Take
    your kinswoman; from now on you are her love, and she is your beloved. She
    is yours today and ever after. And tonight, son, may the Lord of heaven
    prosper you both. May he grant you mercy and peace.” Then Raguel called his
    daughter Sarah, and she came to him. He took her by the hand and gave her to
    Tobiah with the words: “Take her according to the law. According to the
    decree written in the Book of Moses she is your wife. Take her and bring her
    back safely to your father. And may the God of heaven grant both of you
    peace and prosperity.” Raguel then called Sarah's mother and told her to
    bring a scroll, so that he might draw up a marriage contract stating that he
    gave Sarah to Tobiah as his wife according to the decree of the Mosaic law.
    Her mother brought the scroll, and Raguel drew up the contract, to which
    they affixed their seals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Afterward they began to eat and drink. Later Raguel called his wife Edna and
    said, “My love, prepare the other bedroom and bring the girl there.” She
    went and made the bed in the room, as she was told, and brought the girl
    there. After she had cried over her, she wiped away the tears and said: “Be
    brave, my daughter. May the Lord grant you joy in place of your grief.
    Courage, my daughter.” Then she left.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the girl's parents left the bedroom and closed the door behind them,
    Tobiah arose from bed and said to his wife, “My love, get up. Let us pray
    and beg our Lord to have mercy on us and to grant us deliverance.” She got
    up, and they started to pray and beg that deliverance might be theirs. And
    they began to say:
  </p>
  <p>
    “Blessed are you, O God of our fathers, praised be your name forever and
    ever. Let the heavens and all your creation praise you forever. You made
    Adam and you gave him his wife Eve to be his help and support; and from
    these two the human race descended. You said, ‘It is not good for the man to
    be alone; let us make him a partner like himself.' Now, Lord, you know that
    I take this wife of mine not because of lust, but for a noble purpose. Call
    down your mercy on me and on her, and allow us to live together to a happy
    old age.”
  </p>
  <p>They said together, “Amen, amen,” and went to bed for the night.</p>

    Remember the Good News that I carry, 'Jesus Christ risen from the dead,
    sprung from the race of David'; it is on account of this that I have my own
    hardships to bear, even to being chained like a criminal - but they cannot
    chain up God's news. So I bear it all for the sake of those who are chosen,
    so that in the end they may have the salvation that is in Christ Jesus and
    the eternal glory that comes with it. Here is a saying that you rely on: If
    we have died with him, then we shall live with him. If we hold firm, then we
    shall reign with him. If we disown him, then he will disown us. We may be
    unfaithful, but he is always faithful, for he cannot disown his own self.
    Remind them of this; and tell them in the name of God that there is to be no
    wrangling about words: all that this ever achieves is the destruction of
    those who are listening. Do all you can to present yourself in front of God
    as a man who has come through his trials, and a man who has no cause to be
    ashamed of his life's work and has kept a straight course with the message
    of the truth.

    One of the scribes came to Jesus and asked him, “Which is the first of all
    the commandments?” Jesus replied, “The first is this: Hear, O Israel! The
    Lord our God is Lord alone! You shall love the Lord your God with all your
    heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.
    The second is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no
    other commandment greater than these.” The scribe said to him, “Well said,
    teacher. You are right in saying, He is One and there is no other than he.
    And to love him with all your heart, with all your understanding, with all
    your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is worth more than all
    burnt offerings and sacrifices.” And when Jesus saw that he answered with
    understanding, he said to him, “You are not far from the Kingdom of God.”
    And no one dared to ask him any more questions.

    A reading from the Book of Tobit<span class="alindcha">11:5-17</span>
  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    Anna was sitting, watching the road by which her son would come. She was
    sure at once it must be he and said to the father, 'Here comes your son,
    with his companion'. Raphael said to Tobias before he reached his father, 'I
    give you my word that your father's eyes will open. You must put the fish's
    gall to his eyes; the medicine will smart and will draw a filmy white skin
    off his eyes. And your father will be able to see and look on the light.'
    The mother ran forward and threw her arms round her son's neck. 'Now I can
    die,' she said 'I have seen you again.' And she wept. Tobit rose to his feet
    and stumbled across the courtyard through the door. Tobias came on towards
    him (he had the fish's gall in his hand). He blew into his eyes and said,
    steadying him, 'Take courage, father!' With this he applied the medicine,
    left it there a while, then with both hands peeled away a filmy skin from
    the corners of his eyes. Then his father fell on his neck and wept. He
    exclaimed, 'I can see,&nbsp;my son, the light of my eyes!' And he said:
    'Blessed be God! Blessed be his great name! Blessed be all his holy angels!
    Blessed be his great flame for evermore! For he had scourged me and now has
    had pity on me and I see my son Tobias.' Tobias went into the house, and
    with a loud voice joyfully blessed God. Then he told his father everything:
    how his journey had been successful and he had brought the silver back; how
    he had married Sarah, the daughter of Raguel; how she was following him now,
    close behind, and could not be far from the gates of Nineveh. Tobit set off
    to the gates of Nineveh to meet his daughter-in-law, giving joyful praise to
    God as he went. When the people of Nineveh saw him walking without a guide
    and stepping forward as briskly as of old, they were astonished. Tobit
    described to them how God had taken pity on him and had opened his eyes.
    Then Tobit met Sarah, the bride of his son Tobias, and blessed her in these
    words, 'Welcome, daughter! Blessed be your God for sending you to us, my
    daughter. Blessings on your father, blessings on my son Tobias, blessings on
    yourself, my daughter. Welcome now to your own house in joyfulness and in
    blessedness. Come in, my daughter.' He held a feast that day for all the
    Jews of Nineveh.

    When the feasting was over, Tobit called his son Tobias and said, 'My son,
    you ought to think about paying the amount due to your fellow traveler; give
    him more than the figure agreed on'. So Tobias called his companion and
    said, 'Take half of what you brought back, in payment for all you have done,
    and go in peace'. Then Raphael took them both aside and said, 'Bless God,
    utter his praise before all the living for all the favours he has given you.
    Bless and extol his name. Proclaim before all men the deeds of God as they
    deserve, and never tire of giving him thanks. It is right to keep the secret
    of a king, yet right to reveal and publish the works of God. Thank him
    worthily. Do what is good, and no evil can befall you. 'Prayer with fasting
    and alms with right conduct are better than riches with iniquity. Better to
    practice almsgiving than to hoard up gold. Almsgiving saves from death and
    purges every kind of sin. Those who give alms have their fill of days; those
    who commit sin and do evil, bring harm on themselves. I am going to tell you
    the whole truth, hiding nothing from you. I have already told you that it is
    right to keep the secret of a king, yet right too to reveal in worthy
    fashion the works of God. So you must know that when you and Sarah were at
    prayer, it was I who offered your supplications before the glory of the Lord
    and who read them; so too when you were burying the dead. When you did not
    hesitate to get up and leave the table to go and bury a dead man, I was sent
    to test your faith, and at the same time God sent me to heal you and your
    daughter-in-law Sarah. I am Raphael, one of the seven angels who stand ever
    ready to enter the presence of the glory of the Lord.' Now bless the Lord on
    earth and give thanks to God. I am about to return to him above who sent me.

    A reading from the second Letter of Saint Paul to Timothy<span

  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    Before God and before Christ Jesus who is to be judge of the living and the
    dead, I put this duty to you, in the name of his Appearing and of his
    kingdom: proclaim the message and, welcome or unwelcome, insist on it.
    Refute falsehood, correct error, call to obedience - but do all with
    patience and with the intention of teaching. The time is sure to come when,
    far from being content with sound teaching, people will be avid for the
    latest novelty and collect themselves a whole series of teachers according
    to their own tastes; and then, instead of listening to the truth, they will
    turn to myths. Be careful always to choose the right course; be brave under
    trials; make the preaching of the Good News your life's work, in
    thoroughgoing service. As for me, my life is already being poured away as a
    libation, and the time has come for me to be gone. I have fought the good
    fight to the end; I have run the race to the finish; I have kept the faith;
    all there is to come now is the crown of righteousness reserved for me,
    which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that Day; and not
    only to me but to all those who have longed for his Appearing.

    In his teaching to the crowds Jesus said, 'Beware of the scribes who like to
    walk about in long robes, to be greeted obsequiously in the market squares,
    to take the front seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at
    banquets; these are the men who swallow the property of widows, while making
    a show of lengthy prayers. The more severe will be the sentence they
    receive.' He sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting
    money into the treasury, and many of the rich put in a great deal. A poor
    widow came and put in two small coins, the equivalent of a penny. Then he
    called his disciples and said to them, 'I tell you solemnly, this poor widow
    has put more in than all who have contributed to the treasury; for they have
    all put in money they had over, but she from the little she had has put in
    everything she possessed, all she had to live on'.
