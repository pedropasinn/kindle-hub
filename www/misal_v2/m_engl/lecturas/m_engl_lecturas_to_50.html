    With the two tablets of stone in his hands, Moses went up the mountain of
    Sinai in the early morning as the Lord had commanded him. And the Lord
    descended in the form of a cloud, and Moses stood with him there. He called
    on the name of the Lord. The Lord passed before him and proclaimed, 'Lord,
    Lord, a God of tenderness and compassion, slow to anger, rich in kindness
    and faithfulness; And Moses bowed down to the ground at once and worshipped.
    'If I have indeed won your favour, Lord,' he said 'let my Lord come with us,
    I beg. True, they are a headstrong people, but forgive us our faults and our
    sins, and adopt us as your heritage.'

    At that time, Jesus said to Nicodemus: God loved the world so much that he
    gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not be lost but
    may have eternal life. For God sent his Son into the world not to condemn
    the world, but so that through him the world might be saved. No one who
    believes in him will be condemned; but whoever refuses to believe is
    condemned already, because he has refused to believe in the name of God's

    heard? Did ever a people hear the voice of the living God speaking from the

    all this that the Lord your God did for you before your eyes in Egypt?

    The eleven disciples set out for Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had
    arranged to meet them. When they saw him they fell down before him, though
    some hesitated. Jesus came up and spoke to them. He said, 'All authority in
    heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go, therefore, make disciples of
    all the nations; baptise them in the name of the Father and of the Son and
    of the Holy Spirit, and teach them to observe all the commands I gave you.

    Jesus said to the Jews: I am the living bread which has come down from
    heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will live for ever; and the bread that I
    shall give is my flesh, for the life of the world.' Then the Jews started
    arguing with one another: 'How can this man give us his flesh to eat?' they
    said. Jesus replied: I tell you most solemnly, if you do not eat the flesh
    of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in you. Anyone
    who does eat my flesh and drink my blood has eternal life, and I shall raise
    him up on the last day. For my flesh is real food and my blood is real
    drink. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me and I live in
    him. As I, who am sent by the living Father, myself draw life from the
    Father, so whoever eats me will draw life from me. This is the bread come
    down from heaven; not like the bread our ancestors ate: they are dead, but
    anyone who eats this bread will live for ever.'

    Moses went and told the people all the commands of the Lord and all the

    the Lord into writing, and early next morning he built an altar at the foot
    of the mountain, with twelve standing-stones for the twelve tribes of
    Israel. Then he directed certain young Israelites to offer holocausts and to
    immolate bullocks to the Lord as communion sacrifices. Half of the blood
    Moses took up and put into basins, the other half he cast on the altar. And
    taking the Book of the Covenant he read it to the listening people, and they
    said, 'We will observe all that the Lord has decreed; we will obey.' Then
    Moses took the blood and cast it towards the people. 'This' he said 'is the

    Now Christ has come, as the high priest of all the blessings which were to
    come. He has passed through the greater, the more perfect tent, which is
    better than the one made by men's hands because it is not of this created
    order; and he has entered the sanctuary once and for all, taking with him
    not the blood of goats and bull calves, but his own blood, having won an
    eternal redemption for us. The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a
    heifer are sprinkled on those who have incurred defilement and they restore
    the holiness of their outward lives; how much more effectively the blood of
    Christ, who offered himself as the perfect sacrifice to God through the
    eternal Spirit, can purify our inner self from dead actions so that we do
    our service to the living God. He brings a new covenant, as the mediator,
    only so that the people who were called to an eternal inheritance may
    actually receive what was promised: his death took place to cancel the sins
    that infringed the earlier covenant.

    On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was sacrificed,
    his disciples said to Jesus, 'Where do you want us to go and make the
    preparations for you to eat the passover?' So he sent two of his disciples,
    saying to them, 'Go into the city and you will meet a man carrying a pitcher
    of water. Follow him, and say to the owner of the house which he enters,
    "The Master says: Where is my dining room in which I can eat the passover
    with my disciples?" He will show you a large upper room furnished with
    couches, all prepared. Make the preparations for us there,' The disciples
    set out and went to the city and found everything as he had told them, and
    prepared the Passover. And as they were eating he took some bread, and when
    he had said the blessing he broke it and gave it to them. 'Take it,' he said
    'this is my body.' Then he took a cup, and when he had returned thanks he
    gave it to them, and all drank from it, and he said to them, 'This is my
    blood, the blood of the covenant, which is to be poured out for many. I tell
    you solemnly, I shall not drink any more wine until the day I drink the new

    Jesus made the crowds welcome and talked to them about the kingdom of God ;
    and he cured those who were in need of healing. It was late afternoon when
    the Twelve came to him and said, 'Send the people away, and they can go to
    the villages and farms round about to find lodging and food; for we are in a
    lonely place here'. He replied, 'Give them something to eat yourselves'. But
    they said, 'We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we are to
    go ourselves and buy food for all these people' For there were about five
    thousand men. But he said to his disciples, 'Get them to sit down in parties
    of about fifty'. They did so and made them all sit down. Then he took the
    five loaves and the two fish, raised his eyes to heaven, and said the
    blessing over them; then he broke them and handed them to his disciples to
    distribute among the crowd. They all ate as much as they wanted, and when
    the scraps remaining were collected they filled twelve baskets.

    My dear people, let us love one another since love comes from God and
    everyone who loves is begotten by God and knows God. Anyone who fails to
    love can never have known God, because God is love. God's love for us was
    revealed when God sent into the world his only Son so that we could have
    life through him; this is the love I mean: not our love for God, but God's
    love for us when he sent his Son to be the sacrifice that takes our sins
    away. My dear people, since God has loved us so much, we too should love one
    another. No one has ever seen God; but as long as we love one another God
    will live in us and his love will be complete in us. We can know that we are
    living in him and he is living in us because he lets us share his Spirit. We
    ourselves saw and we testify that the Father sent his Son as saviour of the
    world. If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in
    him, and he in God. We ourselves have known and put our faith in God's love
    towards ourselves. God is love and anyone who lives in love lives in God,
    and God lives in him.

    I, Paul, who am less than the least of all the saints have been entrusted
    with this special grace, not only of proclaiming to the pagans the infinite
    treasure of Christ but also of explaining how the mystery is to be
    dispensed. Through all the ages, this has been kept hidden in God, the
    creator of everything. Why? So that the Sovereignties and Powers should
    learn only now, through the Church, how comprehensive God's wisdom really
    is, exactly according to the plan which he had had from all eternity in
    Christ Jesus our Lord. This is why we are bold enough to approach God in
    complete confidence, through our faith in him. This, then, is what I pray,
    kneeling before the Father, from whom every family, whether spiritual or
    natural, takes its name: Out of his infinite glory, may he give you the
    power through his Spirit for your hidden self to grow strong, so that Christ
    may live in your hearts through faith, and then, planted in love and built
    on love, you will with all the saints have strength to grasp the breadth and

    It was Preparation Day, and to prevent the bodies remaining on the cross
    during the sabbath - since that sabbath was a day of special solemnity - the
    Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken away.
    Consequently the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had
    been crucified with him and then of the other. When they came to Jesus, they
    found he was already dead, and so instead of breaking his legs one of the
    soldiers pierced his side with a lance; and immediately there came out blood
    and water. This is the evidence of one who saw it - trustworthy evidence,
    and he knows he speaks the truth - and he gives it so that you may believe
    as well. Because all this happened to fulfil the words of scripture: Not one
    bone of his will be broken; and again, in another place scripture says: They
    will look on the one whom they have pierced.

    The love of God has been poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has
    been given us. We were still helpless when at his appointed moment Christ
    died for sinful men. It is not easy to die even for a good man - though of
    course for someone really worthy, a man might be prepared to die - but what
    proves that God loves us is that Christ died for us while we were still
    sinners. Having died to make us righteous, is it likely that he would now
    fail to save us from God's anger? When we were reconciled to God by the
    death of his Son, we were still enemies; now that we have been reconciled,
    surely we may count on being saved by the life of his Son? Not merely
    because we have been reconciled but because we are filled with joyful trust
    in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have already gained
    our reconciliation.

    Jesus spoke this parable to the scribes and Pharisees: 'What man among you
    with a hundred sheep, losing one, would not leave the ninety-nine in the
    wilderness and go after the missing one till he found it? And when he found
    it, would he not joyfully take it on his shoulders and then, when he got
    home, call together his friends and neighbours? "Rejoice with me," he would
    say "I have found my sheep that was lost." In the same way, I tell you,
    there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one repentant sinner than over
    ninety-nine virtuous men who have no need of repentance.

    Christ has been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of all who have

    in Adam, so all men will be brought to life in Christ; but all of them in

    Christ, those who belong to him. After that will come the end, when he hands
    over the kingdom to God the Father, having done away with every sovereignty,
    authority and power. For he must be king until he has put all his enemies
    under his feet and the last of the enemies to be destroyed is death. And

    Jesus said to his disciples: When the Son of Man comes in his glory,
    escorted by all the angels, then he will take his seat on his throne of
    glory. &nbsp;All the nations will be assembled before him and he will
    separate men one from another as the shepherd separates sheep from goats.
    &nbsp;He will place the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left.
    &nbsp;Then the King will say to those on his right hand, "Come, you whom my
    Father has blessed, take for your heritage the kingdom prepared for you
    since the foundation of the world. &nbsp;For I was hungry and you gave me
    food; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; I was a stranger and you made me
    welcome; &nbsp;naked and you clothed me, sick and you visited me, in prison
    and you came to see me." &nbsp;Then the virtuous will say to him in reply,
    "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you; or thirsty and give you
    drink? &nbsp;When did we see you a stranger and make you welcome; naked and
    clothe you; &nbsp;sick or in prison and go to see you?" &nbsp;And the King
    will answer, "I tell you solemnly, in so far as you did this to one of the
    least of these brothers of mine, you did it to me". &nbsp;Next he will say
    to those on his left hand, "Go away from me, with your curse upon you, to
    the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. &nbsp;For I was
    hungry and you never gave me food; I was thirsty and you never gave me
    anything to drink; &nbsp;I was a stranger and you never made me welcome,
    naked and you never clothed me, sick and in prison and you never visited
    me." &nbsp;Then it will be their turn to ask, "Lord, when did we see you
    hungry or thirsty, a stranger or naked, sick or in prison, and did not come
    to your help?" &nbsp;Then he will answer, "I tell you solemnly, in so far as
    you neglected to do this to one of the least of these, you neglected to do

    &nbsp;they said, 'If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself'.
    &nbsp;Above him there was an inscription: 'This is the King of the Jews'.
