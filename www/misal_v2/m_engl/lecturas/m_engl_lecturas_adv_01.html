    Jesus said to his disciples: 'As it was in Noah's day, so will it be when
    the Son of Man comes. For in those days before the Flood people were eating,
    drinking, taking wives, taking husbands, right up to the day Noah went into
    the ark, and they suspected nothing till the Flood came and swept all away.
    It will be like this when the Son of Man comes. Then of two men in the
    fields one is taken, one left; of two women at the millstone grinding, one
    is taken, one left. 'So stay awake, because you do not know the day when
    your master is coming. You may be quite sure of this that if the householder
    had known at what time of the night the burglar would come, he would have
    stayed awake and would not have allowed anyone to break through the wall of
    his house. Therefore, you too must stand ready because the Son of Man is
    coming at an hour you do not expect.

    When Jesus went into Capernaum a centurion came up and pleaded with him.
    'Sir,' he said 'my servant is lying at home paralysed, and in great pain.'
    'I will come myself and cure him' said Jesus. The centurion replied, 'Sir, I
    am not worthy to have you under my roof; just give the word and my servant
    will be cured. For I am under authority myself, and have soldiers under me;
    and I say to one man: Go, and he goes; to another: Come here, and he comes;
    to my servant: Do this, and he does it.' When Jesus heard this he was
    astonished and said to those following him, 'I tell you solemnly, nowhere in
    Israel have I found faith like this. And I tell you that many will come from
    east and west to take their places with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob at the
    feast in the kingdom of heaven.'

    A shoot springs from the stock of Jesse, a scion thrusts from his roots: on
    him the spirit of the Lord rests, a spirit of wisdom and insight, a spirit
    of counsel and power, a spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.
    (The fear of the Lord is his breath.) He does not judge by appearances, he
    gives no verdict on hearsay, but judges the wretched with integrity, and
    with equity gives a verdict for the poor of the land. His word is a rod that
    strikes the ruthless, his sentences bring death to the wicked. Integrity is
    the loincloth round his waist, faithfulness the belt about his hips. The
    wolf lives with the lamb, the panther lies down with the kid, calf and lion
    cub feed together with a little boy to lead them. The cow and the bear make
    friends, their young lie down together. The lion eats straw like the ox. The
    infant plays over the cobra's hole; into the viper's lair the young child
    puts his hand. They do no hurt, no harm, on all my holy mountain, for the
    country is filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters swell the
    sea. That day, the root of Jesse shall stand as a signal to the peoples. It
    will be sought out by the nations and its home will be glorious.

    It was then that, filled with joy by the Holy Spirit, Jesus said, 'I bless
    you, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, for hiding these things from the
    learned and the clever and revealing them to mere children. Yes, Father, for
    that is what it pleased you to do. Everything has been entrusted to me by my

    Then turning to his disciples he spoke to them in private, 'Happy the eyes

    Jesus reached the shores of the Sea of Galilee, and he went up into the
    hills. He sat there, and large crowds came to him bringing the lame, the
    crippled, the blind, the dumb and many others; these they put down at his
    feet, and he cured them. The crowds were astonished to see the dumb
    speaking, the cripples whole again, the lame walking and the blind with
    their sight, and they praised the God of Israel. But Jesus called his
    disciples to him and said, 'I feel sorry for all these people; they have
    been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to
    send them off hungry, they might collapse on the way.' The disciples said to
    him, 'Where could we get enough bread in this deserted place to feed such a
    crowd?' Jesus said to them, 'How many loaves have you?' 'Seven' they said
    'and a few small fish.' Then he instructed the crowd to sit down on the
    ground, and he took the seven loaves and the fish, and he gave thanks and
    broke them and handed them to the disciples who gave them to the crowds.
    They all ate as much as they wanted, and they collected what was left of the
    scraps, seven baskets full.

    Oxen and donkeys that till the ground will eat a salted fodder, winnowed
    with shovel and fork. On every lofty mountain, on every high hill there will
    be streams and watercourses, on the day of the great slaughter when the
    strongholds fall. Then moonlight will be bright as sunlight and sunlight
    itself be seven times brighter - like the light of seven days in one - on
    the day the Lord dresses the wound of his people and heals the bruises his
    blows have left.

    Jesus made a tour through all the towns and villages, teaching in their
    synagogues, proclaiming the Good News of the kingdom and curing all kinds of
    diseases and sickness. And when he saw the crowds he felt sorry for them
    because they were harassed and dejected, like sheep without a shepherd. Then
    he said to his disciples, 'The harvest is rich but the labourers are few, so
    ask the Lord of the harvest to send labourers to his harvest'. He summoned
    his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits with
    power to cast them out and to cure all kinds of diseases and sickness,
    instructing them as follows: ‘Go rather to the lost sheep of the House of
    Israel. And as you go, proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand.
    Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out devils. You
    received without charge, give without charge.'
