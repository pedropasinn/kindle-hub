    Tormented by thirst, the people complained against Moses. 'Why did you bring
    us out of Egypt ?' they said. 'Was it so that I should die of thirst, my
    children too, and my cattle?' Moses appealed to the Lord. 'How am I to deal
    with this people? he said. 'A little more and they will stone me!' The Lord
    said to Moses, 'Take with you some of the elders of Israel and move on to
    the forefront of the people; take in your hand the staff with which you
    struck the river, and go. I shall be standing before you there on the rock,
    at Horeb. You must strike the rock, and water will flow from it for the
    people to drink.' This is what Moses did, in the sight of the elders of
    Israel. The place was named Massah and Meribah because of the grumbling of
    the sons of Israel and because they put the Lord to the test by saying, 'Is
    the Lord with us, or not?'

    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, by faith we are judged righteous and at peace
    with God, since it is by faith and through Jesus that we have entered this
    state of grace in which we can boast about looking forward to God's glory.
    This hope is not deceptive, because the love of God has been poured into our
    hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given us. We were still helpless
    when at his appointed moment Christ died for sinful men. It is not easy to
    die even for a good man - though of course for someone really worthy, a man
    might be prepared to die - but what proves that God loves us is that Christ
    died for us while we were still sinners.

    Jesus came to the Samaritan town called Sychar, near the land that Jacob
    gave to his son Joseph. Jacob's well is there and Jesus, tired by the
    journey, sat straight down by the well. It was about the sixth hour. When a
    Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, 'Give me a drink'.
    His disciples had gone into the town to buy food. The Samaritan woman said
    to him, 'What? You are a Jew and you ask me, a Samaritan, for a drink?' -
    Jews, in fact, do not associate with Samaritans. Jesus replied: 'If you only
    knew what God is offering and who it is that is saying to you: Give me a
    drink, you would have been the one to ask, and he would have given you
    living water'. 'You have no bucket, sir,' she answered 'and the well is
    deep: how could you get this living water? Are you a greater man than our
    father Jacob who gave us this well and drank from it himself with his sons
    and his cattle?' Jesus replied: 'Whoever drinks this water will get thirsty
    again; but anyone who drinks the water that I shall give will never be
    thirsty again: the water that I shall give will turn into a spring inside
    him, welling up to eternal life'. 'Sir,' said the woman 'give me some of
    that water, so that I may never get thirsty and never have to come here
    again to draw water.' 'Go and call your husband' said Jesus to her 'and come
    back here.' The woman answered, 'I have no husband'. He said to her, 'You
    are right to say, "I have no husband"; for although you have had five, the
    one you have now is not your husband. You spoke the truth there.'&gt; 'I see
    you are a prophet, sir' said the woman. 'Our fathers worshipped on this
    mountain, while you say that Jerusalem is the place where one ought to
    worship.' Jesus said: 'Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when you will
    worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You worship
    what you do not know; we worship what we do know: for salvation comes from
    the Jews. But the hour will come - in fact it is here already - when true
    worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth: that is the kind of
    worshipper the Father wants. God is spirit, and those who worship must
    worship in spirit and truth.' The woman said to him, 'I know that Messiah -
    that is, Christ - is coming; and when he comes he will tell us everything'.
    'I who am speaking to you,' said Jesus 'I am he.' At this point his
    disciples returned, and were surprised to find him speaking to a woman,
    though none of them asked, 'What do you want from her?' or, 'Why are you
    talking to her?' The woman put down her water jar and hurried back&nbsp;to
    the town to tell the people. 'Come and see a man who has told me everything
    I ever did; I wonder if he is the Christ?' This brought people out of the
    town and they started walking towards him. Meanwhile, the disciples were
    urging him, 'Rabbi, do have something to eat; but he said, 'I have food to
    eat that you do not know about'. So the disciples asked one another, 'Has
    someone been bringing him food?' But Jesus said: 'My food is to do the will
    of the one who sent me, and to complete his work. Have you not got a saying:
    Four months and then the harvest? Well, I tell you: Look around you, look at
    the fields; already they are white, ready for harvest! Already the reaper is
    being paid his wages, already he is bringing in the grain for eternal life,
    and thus sower and reaper rejoice together. For here the proverb holds good:
    one sows, another reaps; I sent you to reap a harvest you had not worked
    for. Others worked for it; and you have come into the rewards of their
    trouble.' Many Samaritans of that town had believed in him on the strength
    of the woman's testimony when she said, 'He told me all I have ever done',
    so, when the Samaritans came up to him, they begged him to stay with them.
    He stayed for two days, and when he spoke to them many more came to believe;
    and they said to the woman, 'Now we no longer believe because of what you
    told us; we have heard him ourselves and we know that he really is the
    saviour of the world'.

    Just before the Jewish Passover Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and in the
    Temple he found people selling cattle and sheep and pigeons, and the money
    changers sitting at their counters there. Making a whip out of some cord, he
    drove them all out of the Temple, cattle and sheep as well, scattered the
    money changers' coins, knocked their tables over and said to the
    pigeon-sellers, 'Take all this out of here and stop turning my Father's
    house into a market'. Then his disciples remembered the words of scripture:
    Zeal for your house will devour me. The Jews intervened and said, 'What sign
    can you show us to justify what you have done?' Jesus answered, 'Destroy
    this sanctuary, and in three days I will raise it up'. The Jews replied, 'It
    has taken forty-six years to build this sanctuary: are you going to raise it
    up in three days?' But he was speaking of the sanctuary that was his body,
    and when Jesus rose from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said
    this, and they believed the scripture and the words he had said. During his
    stay in Jerusalem for the Passover many believed in his name when they saw
    the signs that he gave, but Jesus knew them all and did not trust himself to
    them; he never needed evidence about any man; he could tell what a man had
    in him.

    Moses was looking after the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, priest of
    Midian. He led his flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to
    Horeb, the mountain of God. There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in
    the shape of a flame of fire, coming from the middle of a bush. Moses
    looked; there was the bush blazing but it was not being burnt up. 'I must go
    and look at this strange sight,' Moses said 'and see why the bush is not
    burnt.' Now the Lord saw him go forward to look, and God called to him from
    the middle of the bush. 'Moses, Moses!' he said. 'Here I am' he answered.
    'Come no nearer' he said. 'Take off your shoes, for the place on which you
    stand is holy ground. I am the God of your father,' he said 'the God of
    Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.' At this Moses covered his
    face, afraid to look at God. And the Lord said, 'I have seen the miserable
    state of my people in Egypt. I have heard their appeal to be free of their
    slave-drivers. Yes, I am well aware of their sufferings. I mean to deliver
    them out of the hands of the Egyptians and bring them up out of that land to
    a land rich and broad, a land where milk and honey flow. Then Moses said to
    God, 'I am to go, then, to the sons of Israel and say to them, "The God of
    your fathers has sent me to you". But if they ask me what his name is, what
    am I to tell them?' And God said to Moses, 'I Am who I Am. 'This' he added
    'is what you must say to the sons of Israel: "I Am has sent me to you".' And
    God also said to Moses, 'You are to say to the sons of Israel: "The Lord,
    the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God
    of Jacob, has sent me to you". This is my name for all time; by this name I
    shall be invoked for all generations to come.

    I want to remind you, brothers, how our fathers were all guided by a cloud
    above them and how they all passed through the sea. They were all baptised
    into Moses in this cloud and in this sea; all ate the same spiritual food
    and all drank the same spiritual drink, since they all drank from the
    spiritual rock that followed them as they went, and that rock was Christ. In
    spite of this, most of them failed to please God and their corpses littered
    the desert. These things all happened as warnings for us, not to have the
    wicked lusts for forbidden things that they had. You must never complain:
    some of them did, and they were killed by the Destroyer. All this happened
    to them as a warning, and it was written down to be a lesson for us who are
    living at the end of the age. The man who thinks he is safe must be careful
    that he does not fall.

    It was just about this time that some people arrived and told Jesus about
    the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with that of their sacrifices.
    At this he said to them, 'Do you suppose these Galileans who suffered like
    that were greater sinners than any other Galileans? They were not, I tell
    you. No; but unless you repent you will all perish as they did. Or those
    eighteen on whom the tower at Siloam fell and killed them? Do you suppose
    that they were more guilty than all the other people living in Jerusalem ?
    They were not, I tell you. No; but unless you repent you will all perish as
    they did.' He told this parable: 'A man had a fig tree planted in his
    vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it but found none. He said to the
    man who looked after the vineyard, "Look here, for three years now I have
    been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and finding none. Cut it
    down: why should it be taking up the ground?" "Sir," the man replied "leave
    it one more year and give me time to dig round it and manure it: it may bear
    fruit next year; if not, then you can cut it down."'

    Naaman, army commander to the king of Aram, was a man who enjoyed his
    master's respect and favour, since through him the Lord had granted victory
    to the Aramaeans. But the man was a leper. Now on one of their raids, the
    Aramaeans had carried off from the land of Israel a little girl who had
    become a servant of Naaman's wife. She said to her mistress, 'If only my
    master would approach the prophet of Samaria. He would cure him of his
    leprosy.' Naaman went and told his master. 'This and this' he reported 'is
    what the girl from the land of Israel said.' 'Go by all means,' said the
    king of Aram 'I will send a letter to the king of Israel.' So Naaman left,
    taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold and ten
    festal robes. He presented the letter to the king of Israel. It read: 'With
    this letter, I am sending my servant Naaman to you for you to cure him of
    his leprosy'. When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his garments.
    'Am I a god to give death and life,' he said 'that he sends a man to me and
    asks me to cure him of his leprosy? Listen to this, and take note of it and
    see how he intends to pick a quarrel with me.' When Elisha heard that the
    king of Israel had torn his garments, he sent word to the king, 'Why did you
    tear your garments? Let him come to me, and he will find there is a prophet
    in Israel.' So Naaman came with his team and chariot and drew up at the door
    of Elisha's house. And Elisha sent him a messenger to say, 'Go and bathe
    seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will become clean once more'. But
    Naaman was indignant and went off, saying, 'Here was I thinking he would be
    sure to come out to me, and stand there, and call on the name of the Lord
    his God, and wave his hand over the spot and cure the leprous part. Surely
    Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, are better than any water in
    Israel ? Could I not bathe in them and become clean?' And he turned round
    and went off in a rage. But his servants approached him and said, 'My
    father, if the prophet had asked you to do something difficult, would you
    not have done it? All the more reason, then, when he says to you, "Bathe,
    and you will become clean".' So he went down and immersed himself seven
    times in the Jordan, as Elisha had told him to do. And his flesh became
    clean once more like the flesh of a little child. Returning to Elisha with
    his whole escort, he went in and stood before him. 'Now I know' he said
    'that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel.

    Jesus came to Nazara and spoke to the people in the synagogue: 'I tell you
    solemnly, no prophet is ever accepted in his own country. 'There were many
    widows in Israel, I can assure you, in Elijah's day, when heaven remained
    shut for three years and six months and a great famine raged throughout the
    land, but Elijah was not sent to any one of these: he was sent to a widow at
    Zarephath, a Sidonian town. And in the prophet Elisha's time there were many
    lepers in Israel, but none of these was cured, except the Syrian, Naaman.'
    When they heard this everyone in the synagogue was enraged. They sprang to
    their feet and hustled him out of the town; and they took him up to the brow
    of the hill their town was built on, intending to throw him down the cliff,
    but he slipped through the crowd and walked away.

    Peter went up to Jesus and said, 'Lord, how often must I forgive my brother
    if he wrongs me? As often as seven times?' &nbsp;Jesus answered, 'Not seven,
    I tell you, but seventy-seven times. &nbsp;'And so the kingdom of heaven may
    be compared to a king who decided to settle his accounts with his servants.
    &nbsp;When the reckoning began, they brought him a man who owed ten thousand
    talents; &nbsp;but he had no means of paying, so his master gave orders that
    he should be sold, together with his wife and children and all his
    possessions, to meet the debt. &nbsp;At this, the servant threw himself down
    at his master's feet. "Give me time" he said "and I will pay the whole sum."
    &nbsp;And the servant's master felt so sorry for him that he let him go and
    cancelled the debt. &nbsp;Now as this servant went out, he happened to meet
    a fellow servant who owed him one hundred denarii; and he seized him by the
    throat and began to throttle him. "Pay what you owe me" he said. &nbsp;His
    fellow servant fell at his feet and implored him, saying, "Give me time and
    I will pay you". &nbsp;But the other would not agree; on the contrary, he
    had him thrown into prison till he should pay the debt. &nbsp;His fellow
    servants were deeply distressed when they saw what had happened, and they
    went to their master and reported the whole affair to him. &nbsp;Then the
    master sent for him. "You wicked servant," he said "I cancelled all that
    debt of yours when you appealed to me. &nbsp;Were you not bound, then, to
    have pity on your fellow servant just as I had pity on you?" &nbsp;And in
    his anger the master handed him over to the torturers till he should pay all
    his debt. &nbsp;And that is how my heavenly Father will deal with you unless
    you each forgive your brother from your heart.'

    Jesus was casting out a devil and it was dumb; but when the devil had gone
    out the dumb man spoke, and the people were amazed. But some of them said,
    'It is through Beelzebul, the prince of devils, that he casts out devils'.
    Others asked him, as a test, for a sign from heaven; but, knowing what they
    were thinking, he said to them, 'Every kingdom divided against itself is
    heading for ruin, and a household divided against itself collapses. So too
    with Satan: if he is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? -
    Since you assert that it is through Beelzebul that I cast out devils. Now if
    it is through Beelzebul that I cast out devils, through whom do your own
    experts cast them out? Let them be your judges then. But if it is through
    the finger of God that I cast out devils, then know that the kingdom of God
    has overtaken you. So long as a strong man fully armed guards his own
    palace, his goods are undisturbed; but when someone stronger than he is
    attacks and defeats him, the stronger man takes away all the weapons he
    relied on and shares out his spoil. 'He who is not with me is against me;
    and he who does not gather with me scatters.

    The Lord says this: Israel, come back to the Lord your God; your iniquity
    was the cause of your downfall. Provide yourself with words and come back to
    the Lord. Say to him, 'Take all iniquity away so that we may have happiness
    again and offer you our words of praise. Assyria cannot save us, we will not
    ride horses any more, or say, "Our God!" to what our own hands have made,
    for you are the one in whom orphans find compassion. -I will heal their
    disloyalty, I will love them with all my heart, for my anger has turned from
    them. I will fall like dew on Israel. He shall bloom like the lily, and
    thrust out roots like the poplar, his shoots will spread far; he will have
    the beauty of the olive and the fragrance of Lebanon. They will come back to
    live in my shade; they will grow corn that flourishes, they will cultivate
    vines as renowned as the wine of Helbon. What has Ephraim to do with idols
    any more when it is I who hear his prayer and care for him? I am like a
    cypress ever green, all your fruitfulness comes from me. Let the wise man
    understand these words. Let the intelligent man grasp their meaning. For the

    One of the scribes came up to Jesus and put a question to him, 'Which is the
    first of all the commandments?' &nbsp;Jesus replied, 'This is the first:
    Listen, Israel, the Lord our God is the one Lord, &nbsp;and you must love
    the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your
    mind and with all your strength. &nbsp;The second is this: You must love
    your neighbour as yourself. There is no commandment greater than these.'
    &nbsp;The scribe said to him, 'Well spoken, Master; what you have said is
    true: that he is one and there is no other.&nbsp;To love him with all your
    heart, with all your understanding and strength, and to love your neighbour
    as yourself, this is far more important than any holocaust or sacrifice.'
    &nbsp;Jesus, seeing how wisely he had spoken, said, 'You are not far from
    the kingdom of God '. And after that no one dared to question him any more.

    Jesus spoke the following parable to some people who prided themselves on
    being virtuous and despised everyone else, &nbsp;'Two men went up to the
    Temple to pray, one a Pharisee, the other a tax collector. &nbsp;The
    Pharisee stood there and said this prayer to himself, "I thank you, God,
    that I am not grasping, unjust, adulterous like the rest of mankind, and
    particularly that I am not like this tax collector here. &nbsp;I fast twice
    a week; I pay tithes on all I get." &nbsp;The tax collector stood some
    distance away, not daring even to raise his eyes to heaven; but he beat his
    breast and said, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner". &nbsp;This man, I tell
    you, went home again at rights with God; the other did not. For everyone who
    exalts himself will be humbled, but the man who humbles himself will be
    exalted.'
