    If you wish, you can keep the commandments, to behave faithfully is within
    your power. He has set fire and water before you; put out your hand to
    whichever you prefer. Man has life and death before him; whichever a man
    likes better will be given him. For vast is the wisdom of the Lord; he is
    almighty and all-seeing. His eyes are on those who fear him, he notes every
    action of man. He never commanded anyone to be godless, he has given no one
    permission to sin.

    We have a wisdom to offer those who have reached maturity: not a philosophy
    of our age, it is true, still less of the masters of our age, which are
    coming to their end. The hidden wisdom of God which we teach in our
    mysteries is the wisdom that God predestined to be for our glory before the
    ages began. lt is a wisdom that none of the masters of this age have ever
    known, or they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory; we teach what
    scripture calls: the things that no eye has seen and no ear has heard,
    things beyond the mind of man, all that God has prepared for those who love
    him. These are the very things that God has revealed to us through the
    Spirit, for the Spirit reaches the depths of everything, even the depths of
    God.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'Do not imagine that I have come to abolish the
    Law or the Prophets. I have come not to abolish but to complete them. I tell
    you solemnly, till heaven and earth disappear, not one dot, not one little
    stroke, shall disappear from the Law until its purpose is achieved.
    Therefore, the man who infringes even one of the least of these commandments
    and teaches others to do the same will be considered the least in the
    kingdom of heaven; but the man who keeps them and teaches them will be
    considered great in the kingdom of heaven. 'For I tell you, if your virtue
    goes no deeper than that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never get
    into the kingdom of heaven. 'You have learnt how it was said to our
    ancestors: You must not kill; and if anyone does kill he must answer for it
    before the court. But I say this to you: anyone who is angry with his
    brother will answer for it before the court; if a man calls his brother
    "Fool" he will answer for it before the Sanhedrin; and if a man calls him
    "Renegade" he will answer for it in hell fire. So then, if you are bringing
    your offering to the altar and there remember that your brother has
    something against you, leave your offering there before the altar, go and be
    reconciled with your brother first, and then come back and present your
    offering. Come to terms with your opponent in good time while you are still
    on the way to the court with him, or he may hand you over to the judge and
    the judge to the officer, and you will be thrown into prison. I tell you
    solemnly, you will not get out till you have paid the last penny. 'You have
    learnt how it was said: You must not commit adultery. But I say this to you:
    if a man looks at a woman lustfully, he has already committed adultery with
    her in his heart. If your right eye should cause you to sin, tear it out and
    throw it away; for it will do you less harm to lose one part of you than to
    have your whole body thrown into hell. And if your right hand should cause
    you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; for it will do you less harm to
    lose one part of you than to have your whole body go to hell. 'It has also
    been said: Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a writ of dismissal.
    But I say this to you: everyone who divorces his wife, except for the case
    of fornication, makes her an adulteress; and anyone who marries a divorced
    woman commits adultery. 'Again, you have learnt how it was said to our
    ancestors: You must not break your oath, but must fulfil your oaths to the
    Lord. But I say this to you: do not swear at all, either by heaven, since
    that is God's throne; or by the earth, since that is his footstool; or by
    Jerusalem, since that is the city of the great king. Do not swear by your
    own head either, since you cannot turn a single hair white or black. All you
    need say is "Yes" if you mean yes, "No" if you mean no; anything more than
    this comes from the evil one.

    A leper came to Jesus and pleaded on his knees: 'If you want to' he said
    'you can cure me'. Feeling sorry for him, Jesus stretched out his hand and
    touched him. 'Of course I want to!' he said. 'Be cured!' And the leprosy
    left him at once and he was cured. Jesus immediately sent him away and
    sternly ordered him, 'Mind you say nothing to anyone, but go and show
    yourself to the priest, and make the offering for your healing prescribed by
    Moses as evidence of your recovery'. The man went away, but then started
    talking about it freely and telling the story everywhere, so that Jesus
    could no longer go openly into any town, but had to stay outside in places
    where nobody lived. Even so, people from all around would come to him.

    Jesus came down with the Twelve and stopped at a piece of level ground where
    there was a large gathering of his disciples with a great crowd of people
    from all parts of Judaea and from Jerusalem and from the coastal region of
    Tyre and Sidon who had come to hear him and to be cured of their diseases.
    Then fixing his eyes on his disciples he said: 'How happy are you who are
    poor: yours is the kingdom of God. Happy you who are hungry now: you shall
    be satisfied. Happy you who weep now: you shall laugh. Happy are you when
    people hate you, drive you out, abuse you, denounce your name as criminal,
    on account of the Son of Man. Rejoice when that day comes and dance for joy,
    for then your reward will be great in heaven. This was the way their
    ancestors treated the prophets. 'But alas for you who are rich: you are
    having your consolation now. Alas for you who have your fill now: you shall
    go hungry. Alas for you who laugh now: you shall mourn and weep. Alas for
    you when the world speaks well of you! This was the way their ancestors

    Adam knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain. 'I have
    acquired a man with the help of the Lord' she said. She gave birth to a
    second child, Abel, the brother of Cain. Now Abel became a shepherd and kept
    flocks, while Cain tilled the soil. Time passed and Cain brought some of the
    produce of the soil as an offering for the Lord, while Abel for his part
    brought the first-born of his flock and some of their fat as well. The Lord
    looked with favour on Abel and his offering. But he did not look with favour
    on Cain and his offering, and Cain was very angry and downcast. The Lord
    asked Cain, 'Why are you angry and downcast? If you are well disposed, ought
    you not to lift up your head? But if you are ill disposed, is not sin at the
    door like a crouching beast hungering for you, which you must master?' Cain
    said to his brother Abel, 'Let us go out'; and while they were in the open
    country, Cain set on his brother Abel and killed him. The Lord asked Cain,
    'Where is your brother Abel?' 'I do not know' he replied. 'Am I my brother's
    guardian?' 'What have you done?' The Lord asked. 'Listen to the sound of
    your brother's blood, crying out to me from the ground. Now be accursed and
    driven from the ground that has opened its mouth to receive your brother's
    blood at your hands. When you till the ground it shall no longer yield you
    any of its produce. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer over the earth.'
    Then Cain said to the Lord, 'My punishment is greater than I can bear. See!
    Today you drive me from this ground. I must hide from you, and be a fugitive
    and a wanderer&nbsp; over the earth. Why, whoever comes across me will kill
    me!' 'Very well, then,' the Lord replied 'if anyone kills Cain, sevenfold
    vengeance shall be taken for him.' So the Lord put a mark on Cain, to
    prevent whoever might come across him from striking him down. Adam knew his
    wife, and she gave birth to a son whom she named Seth, 'because God has
    granted me other offspring' she said 'in place of Abel, since Cain has
    killed him'.

    From James, servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. Greetings to the
    twelve tribes of the Dispersion. My brothers, you will always have your
    trials but, when they come, try to treat them as a happy privilege; you
    understand that your faith is only put to the test to make you patient, but
    patience too is to have its practical results so that you will become
    fully-developed, complete, with nothing missing. If there is any one of you
    who needs wisdom, he must ask God, who gives to all freely and ungrudgingly;
    it will be given to him. But he must ask with faith, and no trace of doubt,
    because a person who has doubts is like the waves thrown up in the sea when
    the wind drives. That sort of person, in two minds, wavering between going
    different ways, must not expect that the Lord will give him anything. It is
    right for the poor brother to be proud of his high rank, and the rich one to
    be thankful that he has been humbled, because riches last no longer than the
    flowers in the grass; the scorching sun comes up, and the grass withers, the
    flower falls; what looked so beautiful now disappears. It is the same with
    the rich man: his business goes on; he himself perishes.

    him a sign from heaven, to test him. And with a sigh that came straight from
    the heart he said, 'Why does this generation demand a sign? I tell you

    The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that the
    thoughts in his heart fashioned nothing but wickedness all day long. The
    Lord regretted having made man on the earth, and his heart grieved. 'I will
    rid the earth's face of man, my own creation,' the Lord said 'and of animals
    also, reptiles too, and the birds of heaven; for I regret having made them.'
    But Noah had found favour with the Lord. The Lord said to Noah, 'Go aboard
    the ark, you and all your household, for you alone among this generation do
    I see as a good man in my judgement. Of all the clean animals you must take
    seven of each kind, both male and female; of the unclean animals you must
    take two, a male and its female (and of the birds of heaven also, seven of
    each kind, both male and female), to propagate their kind over the whole
    earth. For in seven days' time I mean to make it rain on the earth for forty
    days and nights, and I will rid the earth of every living thing that I
    made.' Noah did all that the Lord ordered. Seven days later the waters of
    the flood appeared on the earth.

    Happy the man who stands firm when trials come. He has proved himself, and
    will win the prize of life, the crown that the Lord has promised to those
    who love him. Never, when you have been tempted, say, 'God sent the
    temptation'; God cannot be tempted to do anything wrong, and he does not
    tempt anybody. Everyone who is tempted is attracted and seduced by his own
    wrong desire. Then the desire conceives and gives birth to sin, and when sin
    is fully grown, it too has a child, and the child is death. Make no mistake
    about this, my dear brothers: it is all that is good, everything that is
    perfect, which is given us from above; it comes down from the Father of all
    light; with him there is no such thing as alteration, no shadow of a change.
    By his own choice he made us his children by the message of the truth so
    that we should be a sort of first-fruits of all that he had created.

    The disciples had forgotten to take any food and they had only one loaf with
    them in the boat. Then Jesus gave them this warning, 'Keep your eyes open;
    be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod'.
    And they said to one another, 'It is because we have no bread'. And Jesus
    knew it, and he said to them, 'Why are you talking about having no bread? Do
    you not yet understand? Have you no perception? Are your minds closed? Have
    you eyes that do not see, ears that do not hear? Or do you not remember?
    When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full
    of scraps did you collect?' They answered, 'Twelve'. And when I broke the
    seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets full of scraps did you
    collect?' And they answered, 'Seven'. Then he said to them, 'Are you still

    At the end of forty days Noah opened the porthole he had made in the ark and
    he sent out the raven. This went off, and flew back and forth until the
    waters dried up from the earth. Then he sent out the dove, to see whether
    the waters were receding from the surface of the earth. The dove, finding
    nowhere to perch, returned to him in the ark, for there was water over the
    whole surface of the earth; putting out his hand he took hold of it and
    brought it back into the ark with him. After waiting seven more days, again
    he sent out the dove from the ark. In the evening, the dove came back to him
    and there it was with a new olive-branch in its beak. So Noah realised that
    the waters were receding from the earth. After waiting seven more days he
    sent out the dove, and now it returned to him no more. It was in the six
    hundred and first year of Noah's life, in the first month and on the first
    of the month, that the water dried up from the earth. Noah lifted back the
    hatch of the ark and looked out. The surface of the ground was dry! Noah
    built an altar for the Lord, and choosing from all the clean animals and all
    the clean birds he offered burnt offerings on the altar. The Lord smelt the
    appeasing fragrance and said to himself, 'Never again will I curse the earth
    because of man, because his heart contrives evil from his infancy. Never
    again will I strike down every living thing as I have done. 'As long as
    earth lasts, sowing and reaping, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and

    Remember this, my dear brothers: be quick to listen but slow to speak and
    slow to rouse your temper; God's righteousness is never served by man's
    anger; so do away with all the impurities and bad habits that are still left
    in you - accept and submit to the word which has been planted in you and can
    save your souls. But you must do what the word tells you, and not just
    listen to it and deceive yourselves. To listen to the word and not obey is
    like looking at your own features in a mirror and then, after a quick look,
    going off and immediately forgetting what you looked like. But the man who
    looks steadily at the perfect law of freedom and makes that his habit - not
    listening and then forgetting, but actively putting it into practice - will
    be happy in all that he does. Nobody must imagine that he is religious while
    he still goes on deceiving himself and not keeping control over his tongue;
    anyone who does this has the wrong idea of religion. Pure, unspoilt
    religion, in the eyes of God our Father is this: coming to the help of
    orphans and widows when they need it, and keeping oneself uncontaminated by
    the world.

    Jesus and his disciples came to Bethsaida, and some people brought to him a
    blind man whom they begged him to touch. He took the blind man by the hand
    and led him outside the village. Then putting spittle on his eyes and laying
    his hands on him, he asked, 'Can you see anything?' The man, who was
    beginning to see, replied, 'I can see people; they look like trees to me,
    but they are walking about'. Then he laid his hands on the man's eyes again
    and he saw clearly; he was cured, and he could see everything plainly and
    distinctly. And Jesus sent him home, saying, 'Do not even go into the
    village'.

    God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, 'Be fruitful, multiply and
    fill the earth. Be the terror and the dread of all the wild beasts and all
    the birds of heaven, of everything that crawls on the ground and all the
    fish of the sea; they are handed over to you. Every living and crawling
    thing shall provide food for you, no less than the foliage of plants. I give
    you everything, with this exception: you must not eat flesh with life, that
    is to say blood, in it. I will demand an account of your life-blood. I will
    demand an account from every beast and from man. I will demand an account of
    every man's life from his fellow men. 'He who sheds man's blood, shall have
    his blood shed by man, for in the image of God man was made. 'As for you, be
    fruitful, multiply, teem over the earth and be lord of it.' God spoke to
    Noah and his sons, 'See, I establish my Covenant with you, and with your
    descendants after you; also with every living creature to be found with you,
    birds, cattle and every wild beast with you:&nbsp; everything that came out
    of the ark, everything that lives on the earth. I establish my Covenant with
    you: no thing of flesh shall be swept away again by the waters of the
    flood.&nbsp; There shall be no flood to destroy the earth again.' God said,
    'Here is the sign of the Covenant I make between myself and you and every
    living creature with you for all generations: I set my bow in the clouds and
    it shall be a sign of the Covenant between me and the earth.

    My brothers, do not try to combine faith in Jesus Christ, our glorified
    Lord, with the making of distinctions between classes of people. Now suppose
    a man comes into your synagogue, beautifully dressed and with a gold ring
    on, and at the same time a poor man comes in, in shabby clothes, and you
    take notice of the well-dressed man, and say, 'Come this way to the best
    seats'; then you tell the poor man, 'Stand over there' or 'You can sit on
    the floor by my foot-rest'. Can't you see that you have used two different
    standards in your mind, and turned yourselves into judges, and corrupt
    judges at that? Listen, my dear brothers: it was those who are poor
    according to the world that God chose, to be rich in faith and to be the
    heirs to the kingdom which he promised to those who love him. In spite of
    this, you have no respect for anybody who is poor. Isn't it always the rich
    who are against you? Isn't it always their doing when you are dragged before
    the court? Aren't they the ones who insult the honourable name to which you
    have been dedicated? Well, the right thing to do is to keep the supreme law
    of scripture: you must love your neighbour as yourself; but as soon as you
    make distinctions between classes of people, you are committing sin, and
    under condemnation for breaking the Law.

    Jesus and his disciples left for the villages round Caesarea Philippi. On
    the way he put this question to his disciples, 'Who do people say I am?' And
    they told him. 'John the Baptist,' they said 'others Elijah; others again,
    one of the prophets.' 'But you,' he asked 'who do you say I am?' Peter spoke
    up and said to him, 'You are the Christ'. And he gave them strict orders not
    to tell anyone about him. And he began to teach them that the Son of Man was
    destined to suffer grievously, to be rejected by the elders and the chief
    priests and the scribes, and to be put to death, and after three days to
    rise again; and he said all this quite openly. Then, taking him aside, Peter
    started to remonstrate with him. But, turning and seeing his disciples, he
    rebuked Peter and said to him, 'Get behind me, Satan! Because the way you
    think is not God's way but man's.'

    Throughout the earth men spoke the same language, with the same vocabulary.
    Now as they moved eastwards they found a plain in the land of Shinar where
    they settled. They said to one another, 'Come, let us make bricks and bake
    them in the fire'.-For stone they used bricks, and for mortar they used
    bitumen.- 'Come,' they said 'let us build ourselves a town and a tower with
    its top reaching heaven. Let us make a name for ourselves, so that we may
    not be scattered about the whole earth.' Now the Lord came down to see the
    town and the tower that the sons of man had built. 'So they are all a single
    people with a single language!' said the Lord. 'This is but the start of
    their undertakings! There will be nothing too hard for them to do. Come, let
    us go down and confuse their language on the spot so that they can no longer
    understand one another.' The Lord scattered them thence over the whole face
    of the earth, and they stopped building the town. It was named Babel
    therefore, because there the Lord confused the language of the whole earth.
    It was from there that the Lord scattered them over the whole face of the
    earth.

    Take the case, my brothers, of someone who has never done a single good act
    but claims that he has faith. Will that faith save him? If one of the
    brothers or one of the sisters is in need of clothes and has not enough food
    to live on, and one of you says to them, 'I wish you well; keep yourself
    warm and eat plenty', without giving them these bare necessities of life,
    then what good is that? Faith is like that: if good works do not go with it,
    it is quite dead. This is the way to talk to people of that kind: 'You say
    you have faith and I have good deeds; I will prove to you that I have faith
    by showing you my good deeds - now you prove to me that you have faith
    without any good deeds to show. You believe in the one God - that is
    creditable enough, but the demons have the same belief, and they tremble
    with fear. Do realise, you senseless man, that faith without good deeds is
    useless. You surely know that Abraham our father was justified by his deed,
    because he offered his son Isaac on the altar? There you see it: faith and
    deeds were working together; his faith became perfect by what he did. This
    is what scripture really means when it says: Abraham put his faith in God,
    and this was counted as making him justified; and that is why he was called
    'the friend of God'. You see now that it is by doing something good, and not
    only by believing, that a man is justified. A body dies when it is separated
    from the spirit, and in the same way faith is dead if it is separated from
    good deeds.

    Jesus called the people and his disciples to him and said, 'If anyone wants
    to be a follower of mine, let him renounce himself and take up his cross and
    follow me. For anyone who wants to save his life will lose it; but anyone
    who loses his life for my sake, and for the sake of the gospel, will save
    it. What gain, then, is it for a man to win the whole world and ruin his
    life? And indeed what can a man offer in exchange for his life? For if
    anyone in this adulterous and sinful generation is ashamed of me and of my
    words, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory
    of his Father with the holy angels.' And he said to them, 'I tell you

    Only faith can guarantee the blessings that we hope for, or prove the
    existence of the realities that at present remain unseen. It was for faith
    that our ancestors were commended. It is by faith that we understand that
    the world was created by one word from God, so that no apparent cause can
    account for the things we can see. It was because of his faith that Abel
    offered God a better sacrifice than Cain, and for that he was declared to be
    righteous when God made acknowledgement of his offerings. Though he is dead,
    he still speaks by faith. It was because of his faith that Enoch was taken
    up and did not have to experience death: he was not to be found because God
    had taken him. This was because before his assumption it is attested that he
    had pleased God. Now it is impossible to please God without faith, since
    anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and rewards those who
    try to find him. It was through his faith that Noah, when he had been warned
    by God of something that had never been seen before, felt a holy fear and
    built an ark to save his family. By his faith the world was convicted, and
    he was able to claim the righteousness which is the reward of faith.

    Only a few of you, my brothers, should be teachers, bearing in mind that
    those of us who teach can expect a stricter judgement. After all, every one
    of us does something wrong, over and over again; the only man who could
    reach perfection would be someone who never said anything wrong - he would
    be able to control every part of himself. Once we put a bit into the horse's
    mouth, to make it do what we want, we have the whole animal under our
    control. Or think of ships: no matter how big they are, even if a gale is
    driving them, the man at the helm can steer them anywhere he likes by
    controlling a tiny rudder. So is the tongue only a tiny part of the body,
    but it can proudly claim that it does great things. Think how small a flame
    can set fire to a huge forest; the tongue is a flame like that. Among all
    the parts of the body, the tongue is a whole wicked world in itself: it
    infects the whole body; catching fire itself from hell, it sets fire to the
    whole wheel of creation. Wild animals and birds, reptiles and fish can all
    be tamed by man, and often are; but nobody can tame the tongue - it is a
    pest that will not keep still, full of deadly poison. We use it to bless the
    Lord and Father, but we also use it to curse men who are made in God's
    image: the blessing and the curse come out of the same mouth. My brothers,
    this must be wrong.

    Jesus took with him Peter and James and John and led them up a high mountain
    where they could be alone by themselves. There in their presence he was
    transfigured: his clothes became dazzlingly white, whiter than any earthly
    bleacher could make them. Elijah appeared to them with Moses; and they were
    talking with Jesus. Then Peter spoke to Jesus: 'Rabbi,' he said 'it is
    wonderful for us to be here; so let us make three tents, one for you, one
    for Moses and one for Elijah'. He did not know what to say; they were so
    frightened. And a cloud came, covering them in shadow; and there came a
    voice from the cloud, 'This is my Son, the Beloved. Listen to him.' Then
    suddenly, when they looked round, they saw no one with them any more but
    only Jesus. As they came down from the mountain he warned them to tell no
    one what they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
    They observed the warning faithfully, though among themselves they discussed
    what 'rising from the dead' could mean. And they put this question to him,
    'Why do the scribes say that Elijah has to come first?' 'True,' he said
    'Elijah is to come first and to see that everything is as it should be; yet
    how is it that the scriptures say about the Son of Man that he is to suffer
    grievously and be treated with contempt? However, I tell you that Elijah has
    come and they have treated him as they pleased, just as the scriptures say
    about him.'
