    The Lord said to Moses, ‘Tell the sons of Israel this, "You must not molest
    the stranger or oppress him, for you lived as strangers in the land of
    Egypt. &nbsp;You must not be harsh with the widow, or with the orphan;
    &nbsp;if you are harsh with them, they will surely cry out to me, and be
    sure I shall hear their cry; &nbsp;my anger will flare and I shall kill you
    with the sword, your own wives will be widows, your own children orphans.
    &nbsp;"If you lend money to any of my people, to any poor man among you, you
    must not play the usurer with him: you must not demand interest from him.
    &nbsp;"If you take another's cloak as a pledge, you must give it back to him
    before sunset. &nbsp;It is all the covering he has; it is the cloak he wraps
    his body in; what else would he sleep in? If he cries to me, I will listen,
    for I am full of pity.

    When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees they got
    together &nbsp;and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,

    said, 'You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your

    Every high priest has been taken out of mankind and is appointed to act for
    men in their relations with God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins; and
    so &nbsp;he can sympathise with those who are ignorant or uncertain because
    he too lives in the limitations of weakness. &nbsp;That is why he has to
    make sin offerings for himself as well as for the people. &nbsp;No one takes
    this honour on himself, but each one is called by God, as Aaron was.
    &nbsp;Nor did Christ give himself the glory of becoming high priest, but he
    had it from the one who said to him: You are my son, today I have become
    your father, &nbsp;and in another text: You are a priest of the order of
    Melchizedek, and for ever.

    As Jesus left Jericho with his disciples and a large crowd, Bartimaeus (that
    is, the son of Timaeus), a blind beggar, was sitting at the side of the
    road. &nbsp;When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout
    and to say, 'Son of David, Jesus, have pity on me'. &nbsp;And many of them
    scolded him and told him to keep quiet, but he only shouted all the louder,
    'Son of David, have pity on me'. &nbsp;Jesus stopped and said, 'Call him
    here'. So they called the blind man. 'Courage,' they said 'get up; he is
    calling you.' &nbsp;So throwing off his so cloak, he jumped up and went to
    Jesus. &nbsp;Then Jesus spoke, 'What do you want me to do for you?'
    'Rabbuni, the blind man said to him 'Master, let me see again.' &nbsp;Jesus
    said to him, 'Go; your faith has saved you'. And immediately his sight
    returned and he followed him along the road.

    Jesus spoke the following parable to some people who prided themselves on
    being virtuous and despised everyone else, &nbsp;'Two men went up to the
    Temple to pray, one a Pharisee, the other a tax collector. &nbsp;The
    Pharisee stood there and said this prayer to himself, "I thank you, God,
    that I am not grasping, unjust, adulterous like the rest of mankind, and
    particularly that I am not like this tax collector here. &nbsp;I fast twice
    a week; I pay tithes on all I get." &nbsp;The tax collector stood some
    distance away, not daring even to raise his eyes to heaven; but he beat his
    breast and said, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner". &nbsp;This man, I tell
    you, went home again at rights with God; the other did not. For everyone who
    exalts himself will be humbled, but the man who humbles himself will be

    My brothers, there is no necessity for us to obey our unspiritual selves or

    One sabbath day Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, &nbsp;and a
    woman was there who for eighteen years had been possessed by a spirit that
    left her enfeebled; she was bent double and quite unable to stand upright.
    &nbsp;When Jesus saw her he called her over and said, 'Woman, you are rid of
    your infirmity' &nbsp;and he laid his hands on her. And at once she
    straightened up, and she glorified God. &nbsp;But the synagogue official was
    indignant because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, and he addressed the
    people present. 'There are six days' he said 'when work is to be done. Come
    and be healed on one of those days and not on the sabbath.' &nbsp;But the
    Lord answered him. 'Hypocrites!' he said 'Is there one of you who does not
    untie his ox or his donkey from the manger on the sabbath and take it out
    for watering? &nbsp;And this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has
    held bound these eighteen years - was it not right to untie her bonds on the
    sabbath day?' &nbsp;When he said this, all his adversaries were covered with
    confusion, and all the people were overjoyed at all the wonders he worked.

    I think that what we suffer in this life can never be compared to the glory,
    as yet unrevealed, which is waiting for us. &nbsp;The whole creation is
    eagerly waiting for God to reveal his sons. &nbsp;It was not for any fault
    on the part of creation that it was made unable to attain its purpose, it
    was made so by God; but creation still retains the hope &nbsp;of being
    freed, like us, from its slavery to decadence, to enjoy the same freedom and
    glory as the children of God. &nbsp;From the beginning till now the entire
    creation, as we know, has been groaning in one great act of giving birth;
    &nbsp;and not only creation, but all of us who possess the first-fruits of
    the Spirit, we too groan inwardly as we wait for our bodies to be set free.
    &nbsp;For we must be content to hope that we shall be saved - our salvation
    is not in sight, we should not have to be hoping for it if it were -
    &nbsp;but, as I say, we must hope to be saved since we are not saved yet -
    it is something we must wait for with patience.

    Give way to one another in obedience to Christ. &nbsp;Wives should regard
    their husbands as they regard the Lord, &nbsp;since as Christ is head of the
    Church and saves the whole body, so is a husband the head of his wife;
    &nbsp;and as the Church submits to Christ, so should wives to their
    husbands, in everything. &nbsp;Husbands should love their wives just as
    Christ loved the Church and sacrificed himself for her &nbsp;to make her
    holy. He made her clean by washing her in water with a form of words,
    &nbsp;so that when he took her to himself she would be glorious, with no
    speck or wrinkle or anything like that, but holy and faultless. &nbsp;In the
    same way, husbands must love their wives as they love their own bodies; for
    a man to love his wife is for him to love himself. &nbsp;A man never hates
    his own body, but he feeds it and looks after it; and that is the way Christ
    treats the Church, &nbsp;because it is his body-and we are its living parts.
    &nbsp;For this reason, a man must leave his father and mother and be joined
    to his wife, and the two will become one body. &nbsp;This mystery has many
    implications; but I am saying it applies to Christ and the Church. &nbsp;To
    sum up; you too, each one of you, must love his wife as he loves himself;
    and let every wife respect her husband.

    Through towns and villages Jesus went teaching, making his way to Jerusalem.
    &nbsp;Someone said to him, 'Sir, will there be only a few saved?' He said to
    them, &nbsp;'Try your best to enter by the narrow door, because, I tell you,
    many will try to enter and will not succeed. &nbsp;'Once the master of the
    house has got up and locked the door, you may find yourself knocking on the
    door, saying, "Lord, open to us" but he will answer, "I do not know where

    drank in your company; you taught in our streets" &nbsp;but he will reply,
    "I do not know where you come from. Away from me, all you wicked
    men!"&nbsp;'Then there will be weeping and grinding of teeth, when you see
    Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and
    yourselves turned outside. &nbsp;And men from east and west, from north and
    south, will come to take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God.

    With God on our side who can be against us? &nbsp;'Since God did not spare
    his own Son, but gave him up to benefit us all, we may be certain, after
    such a gift, that he will not refuse anything he can give. &nbsp;Could

    Grow strong in the Lord, with the strength of his power. &nbsp;Put God's
    armour on so as to be able to resist the devil's tactics. &nbsp;For it is
    not against human enemies that we have to struggle, but against the
    Sovereignties and the Powers who originate the darkness in this world, the
    spiritual army of evil in the heavens. &nbsp;That is why you must rely on
    God's armour, or you will not be able to put up any resistance when the
    worst happens, or have enough resources to hold your ground. &nbsp;So stand
    your ground, with truth buckled round your waist, and integrity for a
    breastplate, &nbsp;wearing for shoes on your feet the eagerness to spread
    the gospel of peace &nbsp;and always carrying the shield of faith so that
    you can use it to put out the burning arrows of the evil one. &nbsp;And then
    you must accept salvation from God to be your helmet and receive the word of
    God from the Spirit to use as a sword. &nbsp;Pray all the time, asking for
    what you need, praying in the Spirit on every possible occasion. Never get
    tired of staying awake to pray for all the saints; &nbsp;and pray for me to
    be given an opportunity to open my mouth and speak without fear and give out
    the mystery of the gospel &nbsp;of which I am an ambassador in chains; pray
    that in proclaiming it I may speak as boldly as I ought to.

    Just at this time some Pharisees came up to Jesus. 'Go away' they said.
    'Leave this place, because Herod means to kill you.' &nbsp;He replied, 'You
    may go and give that fox this message: Learn that today and tomorrow I cast
    out devils and on the third day attain my end. &nbsp;But for today and
    tomorrow and the next day I must go on, since it would not be right for a

    From Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ

    the grace and peace of God our Father and of the Lord Jesus Christ. &nbsp;I

    privileges which have been mine: both my chains and my work defending and
    establishing the gospel. You have a permanent place in my heart, &nbsp;and
    God knows how much I miss you all, loving you as Christ Jesus loves you.
    &nbsp;My prayer is that your love for each other may increase more and more
    and never stop improving your knowledge and deepening your perception.
    &nbsp;so that you can always recognise what is best. This will help you to
    become pure and blameless, and prepare you for the Day of Christ, &nbsp;when

    On a sabbath day Jesus had gone for a meal to the house of one of the
    leading Pharisees; and they watched him closely. &nbsp;'There in front of
    him was a man with dropsy, &nbsp;and Jesus addressed the lawyers and
    Pharisees. 'Is it against the law' he asked 'to cure a man on the sabbath,
    or not?' &nbsp;But they remained silent, so he took the man and cured him
    and sent him away. &nbsp;Then he said to them, 'Which of you here, if his
    son falls into a well, or his ox, will not pull him out on a sabbath day
    without hesitation?' And to this they could find no answer.

    Let me put a further question then: is it possible that God has rejected his
    people? Of course not. I, an Israelite, descended from Abraham through the
    tribe of Benjamin, &nbsp;could never agree that God had rejected his people,
    the people he chose specially long ago. &nbsp;Let me put another question
    then: have the Jews fallen for ever, or have they just stumbled? Obviously
    they have not fallen for ever: their fall, though, has saved the pagans in a
    way the Jews may now well emulate. &nbsp;Think of the extent to which the
    world, the pagan world, has benefited from their fall and defection - then
    think how much more it will benefit from the conversion of them all.
    &nbsp;There is a hidden reason for all this, brothers, of which I do not
    want you to be ignorant, in case you think you know more than you do. One
    section of Israel has become blind, but this will last only until the whole
    pagan world has entered, &nbsp;and then after this the rest of Israel will
    be saved as well. As scripture says: The liberator will come from Zion, he
    will banish godlessness from Jacob. &nbsp;And this is the covenant I will
    make with them when I take their sins away. &nbsp;The Jews are enemies of
    God only with regard to the Good News, and enemies only for your sake; but
    as the chosen people, they are still loved by God, loved for the sake of
    their ancestors. &nbsp;God never takes back his gifts or revokes his choice.

    honour. He said this, &nbsp;'When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do
    not take your seat in the place of honour. A more distinguished person than
    you may have been invited, &nbsp;and the person who invited you both may
    come and say, "Give up your place to this man". And then, to your
    embarrassment, you would have to go and take the lowest place. &nbsp;No;
    when you are a guest, make your way to the lowest place and sit there, so
    that, when your host comes, he may say, "My friend, move up higher". In that
    way, everyone with you at the table will see you honoured.&nbsp;For everyone
    who exalts himself will be humbled, and the man who humbles himself will be
    exalted.'
