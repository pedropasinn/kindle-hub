    People must think of us as Christ's servants, stewards entrusted with the
    mysteries of God. What is expected of stewards is that each one should be
    found worthy of his trust. Not that it makes the slightest difference to me
    whether you, or indeed any human tribunal, find me worthy or not. I will not
    even pass judgment on myself. True, my conscience does not reproach me at
    all, but that does not prove that I am acquitted: the Lord alone is my
    judge. There must be no passing of premature judgment. Leave that until the
    Lord comes; he will light up all that is hidden in the dark and reveal the
    secret intentions of men's hearts. Then will be the time for each one to
    have whatever praise he deserves, from God.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'No one can be the slave of two masters: he
    will either hate the first and love the second, or treat the first with
    respect and the second with scorn. You cannot be the slave both of God and
    of money. 'That is why I am telling you not to worry about your life and
    what you are to eat, nor about your body and how you are to clothe it.
    Surely life means more than food, and the body more than clothing! Look at
    the birds in the sky. They do not sow or reap or gather into barns; yet your
    heavenly Father feeds them. Are we not worth much more than they are? Can
    any of you, for all his worrying, add one single cubit to his span of life?
    And why worry about clothing? Think of the flowers growing in the fields;
    they never have to work or spin; yet I assure you that not even Solomon in
    all his regalia was robed like one of these. Now if that is how God clothes
    the grass in the field which is there today and thrown into the furnace
    tomorrow, will he not much more look after you, you men of little faith? So
    do not worry; do not say, "What are we to eat? What are we to drink? How are
    we to be clothed?" It is the pagans who set their hearts on all these
    things. Your heavenly Father knows you need them all. Set your hearts on his
    kingdom first, and on his righteousness, and all these other things will be
    given you as well. So do not worry about tomorrow: tomorrow will take care
    of itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

    drawn up by us, and written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living

    One day when John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, some people
    came and said to Jesus, 'Why is it that John's disciples and the disciples
    of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?' Jesus replied, 'Surely
    the bridegroom's attendants would never think of fasting while the
    bridegroom is still with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with
    them, they could not think of fasting. But the time will come for the
    bridegroom to be taken away from them, and then, on that day, they will
    fast. No one sews a piece of unshrunken cloth on an old cloak; if he does,
    the patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and the tear gets worse.
    And nobody puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the wine will burst
    the skins, and the wine is lost and the skins too. No! New wine, fresh
    skins!'

    Jesus told a parable to his disciples. 'Can one blind man guide another?
    Surely both will fall into a pit? The disciple is not superior to his
    teacher; the fully trained disciple will always be like his teacher. Why do
    you observe the splinter in your brother's eye and never notice the plank in
    your own? How can you say to your brother, "Brother, let me take out the
    splinter that is in your eye", when you cannot see the plank in your own?
    Hypocrite! Take the plank out of your own eye first, and then you will see
    clearly enough to take out the splinter that is in your brother's eye.
    'There is no sound tree that produces rotten fruit, nor again a rotten tree
    that produces sound fruit. For every tree can be told by its own fruit:
    people do not pick figs from thorns, nor gather grapes from brambles. A good
    man draws what is good from the store of goodness in his heart; a bad man
    draws what is bad from the store of badness. For a man's words flow out of
    what fills his heart.

    Jesus was setting out on a journey when a man ran up, knelt before him and
    put this question to him, 'Good master, what must I do to inherit eternal
    life?' Jesus said to him, 'Why do you call me good? No one is good but God
    alone. You know the commandments: You must not kill; You must not commit
    adultery; You must not steal; You must not bring false witness; You must not
    defraud; Honour your father and mother.' And he said to him, 'Master, I have
    kept all these from my earliest days'. Jesus looked steadily at him and
    loved him, and he said, 'There is one thing you lack. Go and sell everything
    you own and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in
    heaven; then come, follow me.' But his face fell at these words and he went
    away sad, for he was a man of great wealth. Jesus looked round and said to
    his disciples, 'How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the
    kingdom of God!' The disciples were astounded by these words, but Jesus
    insisted, 'My children,' he said to them 'how hard it is to enter the
    kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle
    than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God .' They were more astonished
    than ever. 'In that case' they said to one another 'who can be saved?' Jesus
    gazed at them. 'For men' he said 'it is impossible, but not for God: because
    everything is possible for God.'

    A man multiplies offerings by keeping the Law; he offers communion
    sacrifices by following the commandments. By showing gratitude he makes an
    offering of fine flour, by giving alms he offers a sacrifice of praise.
    Withdraw from wickedness and the Lord will be pleased, withdraw from
    injustice and you make atonement. Do not appear empty-handed in the Lord's
    presence; for all these things are due under the commandment. A virtuous
    man's offering graces the altar, and its savour rises before the Most High.
    A virtuous man's sacrifice is acceptable, its memorial will not be
    forgotten. Honour the Lord with generosity, do not stint the first-fruits
    you bring. Add a smiling face to all your gifts, and be cheerful as you
    dedicate your tithes. Give to the Most High as he has given to you,
    generously as your means can afford; for the Lord is a good rewarder, he
    will reward you seven times over. Offer him no bribe, he will not accept it,
    do not put your faith in an unvirtuous sacrifice; since the Lord is a judge
    who is no respecter of personages.

    It was this salvation that the prophets were looking and searching so hard
    for; their prophecies were about the grace which was to come to you. The
    Spirit of Christ which was in them foretold the sufferings of Christ and the
    glories that would come after them, and they tried to find out at what time
    and in what circumstances all this was to be expected. It was revealed to
    them that the news they brought of all the things which have now been
    announced to you, by those who preached to you the Good News through the
    Holy Spirit sent from heaven, was for you and not for themselves. Even the
    angels long to catch a glimpse of these things. Free your minds, then, of
    encumbrances; control them, and put your trust in nothing but the grace that
    will be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed. Do not behave in the way
    that you liked to before you learnt the truth; make a habit of obedience: be
    holy in all you do, since it is the Holy One who has called you, and
    scripture says: Be holy, for I am holy.

    The disciples were on the road, going up to Jerusalem; Jesus was walking on
    ahead of them; they were in a daze, and those who followed were
    apprehensive. Once more taking the Twelve aside he began to tell them what
    was going to happen to him: 'Now we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son
    of Man is about to be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes. They
    will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the pagans, who will
    mock him and spit at him and scourge him and put him to death; and after
    three days he will rise again.' James and John, the sons of Zebedee,
    approached him. 'Master,' they said to him 'we want you to do us a favour.'
    He said to them, 'What is it you want me to do for you?' They said to him,
    'Allow us to sit one at your right hand and the other at your left in your
    glory'. 'You do not know what you are asking' Jesus said to them. 'Can you
    drink the cup that I must drink, or be baptised with the baptism with which
    I must be baptised?' They replied, 'We can'. Jesus said to them, 'The cup
    that I must drink you shall drink, and with the baptism with which I must be
    baptised you shall be baptised, but as for seats at my right hand or my
    left, these are not mine to grant; they belong to those to whom they have
    been allotted'. When the other ten heard this they began to feel indignant
    with James and John, so Jesus called them to him and said to them, 'You know
    that among the pagans their so-called rulers lord it over them, and their
    great men make their authority felt. This is not to happen among you. No;
    anyone who wants to become great among you must be your servant, and anyone
    who wants to be first among you must be slave to all. For the Son of Man
    himself did not come to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a
    ransom for many.'

    You are new born, and, like babies, you should be hungry for nothing but
    milk - the spiritual honesty which will help you to grow up to salvation -
    now that you have tasted the goodness of the Lord. He is the living stone,
    rejected by men but chosen by God and precious to him; set yourselves close
    to him so that you too, the holy priesthood that offers the spiritual
    sacrifices which Jesus Christ has made acceptable to God, may be living
    stones making a spiritual house. But you are a chosen race, a royal
    priesthood, a consecrated nation, a people set apart to sing the praises of
    God who called you out of the darkness into his wonderful light. Once you
    were not a people at all and now you are the People of God; once you were
    outside the mercy and now you have been given mercy. I urge you, my dear
    people, while you are visitors and pilgrims to keep yourselves free from the
    selfish passions that attack the soul. Always behave honourably among pagans
    so that they can see your good works for themselves and, when the day of
    reckoning comes, give thanks to God for the things which now make them
    denounce you as criminals.

    As Jesus left Jericho with his disciples and a large crowd, Bartimaeus (that
    is, the son of Timaeus), a blind beggar, was sitting at the side of the
    road. &nbsp;When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout
    and to say, 'Son of David, Jesus, have pity on me'. &nbsp;And many of them
    scolded him and told him to keep quiet, but he only shouted all the louder,
    'Son of David, have pity on me'. &nbsp;Jesus stopped and said, 'Call him
    here'. So they called the blind man. 'Courage,' they said 'get up; he is
    calling you.' &nbsp;So throwing off his cloak, he jumped up and went to
    Jesus. &nbsp;Then Jesus spoke, 'What do you want me to do for you?'
    'Rabbuni, the blind man said to him 'Master, let me see again.' &nbsp;Jesus
    said to him, 'Go; your faith has saved you'. And immediately his sight
    returned and he followed him along the road.

    good stewards responsible for all these different graces of God, put
    yourselves at the service of others. If you are a speaker, speak in words

    After he had been acclaimed by the crowds, Jesus entered Jerusalem and went
    into the Temple. He looked all round him, but as it was now late, he went
    out to Bethany with the Twelve. Next day as they were leaving Bethany, he
    felt hungry. Seeing a fig tree in leaf some distance away, he went to see if
    he could find any fruit on it, but when he came up to it he found nothing
    but leaves; for it was not the season for figs. And he addressed the fig
    tree. 'May no one ever eat fruit from you again' he said. And his disciples
    heard him say this. So they reached Jerusalem and he went into the Temple
    and began driving out those who were selling and buying there; he upset the
    tables of the money changers and the chairs of those who were selling
    pigeons. Nor would he allow anyone to carry anything through the Temple. And
    he taught them and said, 'Does not scripture say: My house will be called a
    house of prayer for all the peoples? But you have turned it into a robbers'
    den.' This came to the ears of the chief priests and the scribes, and they
    tried to find some way of doing away with him; they were afraid of him
    because the people were carried away by his teaching. And when evening came
    he went out of the city. Next morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig
    tree withered to the roots. Peter remembered. 'Look, Rabbi,' he said to
    Jesus 'the fig tree you cursed has withered away.' Jesus answered, 'Have
    faith in God. I tell you solemnly, if anyone says to this mountain, "Get up
    and throw yourself into the sea", with no hesitation in his heart but
    believing that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. I tell you
    therefore: everything you ask and pray for, believe that you have it
    already, and it will be yours. And when you stand in prayer, forgive
    whatever you have against anybody, so that your Father in heaven may forgive
    your failings too. But if you do not forgive, your Father in heaven will not
    forgive your failings either.'

    I will thank you and praise you, and bless the name of the Lord. When I was
    still a youth, before I went travelling, in my prayers I asked outright for
    wisdom. Outside the sanctuary I would pray for her, and to the last I will
    continue to seek her. From her blossoming to the ripening of her grape my
    heart has taken its delight in her. My foot has pursued a straight path, I
    have been following her steps ever since my youth. By bowing my ear a little
    I have received her, and have found much instruction. Thanks to her I have
    advanced; the glory be to him who has given me wisdom! For I am determined
    to put her into practice, I have earnestly pursued what is good, I will not
    be put to shame. My soul has fought to possess her, I have been scrupulous
    in keeping the Law; I have stretched out my hands to heaven and bewailed my

    Remember, my dear friends, what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ told

    Jesus and his disciples came to Jerusalem again, and as Jesus was walking in
    the Temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him,
    and they said to him, 'What authority have you for acting like this? Or who
    gave you authority to do these things?' Jesus said to them, 'I will ask you
    a question, only one; answer me and I will tell you my authority for acting
    like this. John's baptism: did it come from heaven, or from man? Answer me
    that.' And they argued it out this way among themselves: 'If we say from
    heaven, he will say, "Then why did you refuse to believe him?" But dare we
    say from man?' - they had the people to fear, for everyone held that John
    was a real prophet. So their reply to Jesus was, 'We do not know'. And Jesus
