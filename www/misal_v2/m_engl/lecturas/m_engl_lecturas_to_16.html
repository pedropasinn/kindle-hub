    There is no god, other than you, who cares for every thing, to whom you
    might have to prove that you never judged unjustly; Your justice has its
    source in strength, your sovereignty over all makes you lenient to all. You
    show your strength when your sovereign power is questioned and you expose
    the insolence of those who know it; but, disposing of such strength, you are
    mild in judgement, you govern us with great lenience, for you have only to
    will, and your power is there. By acting thus you have taught a lesson to
    your people how the virtuous man must be kindly to his fellow men, and you
    have given your sons the good hope that after sin you will grant repentance.

    Jesus put another parable before the crowds: 'The kingdom of heaven may be
    compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field. While everybody was
    asleep his enemy came, sowed darnel all among the wheat, and made off. When
    the new wheat sprouted and ripened, the darnel appeared as well. The owner's
    servants went to him and said, "Sir, was it not good seed that you sowed in
    your field? If so, where does the darnel come from?" "Some enemy has done
    this" he answered. And the servants said, "Do you want us to go and weed it
    out?" But he said, "No, because when you weed out the darnel you might pull
    up the wheat with it. Let them both grow till the harvest; and at harvest
    time I shall say to the reapers: First collect the darnel and tie it in
    bundles to be burnt, then gather the wheat into my barn."' He put another
    parable before them, 'The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a
    man took and sowed in his field. It is the smallest of all the seeds, but
    when it has grown it is the biggest shrub of all and becomes a tree so that
    the birds of the air come and shelter in its branches.' He told them another
    parable, 'The kingdom of heaven is like the yeast a woman took and mixed in
    with three measures of flour till it was leavened all through'. In all this
    Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables; indeed, he would never speak to them
    except in parables. This was to fulfil the prophecy: I will speak to you in
    parables and expound things hidden since the foundation of the world. Then,
    leaving the crowds, he went to the house; and his disciples came to him and
    said, 'Explain the parable about the darnel in the field to us'. He said in
    reply, 'The sower of the good seed is the Son of Man. The field is the
    world; the good seed is the subjects of the kingdom; the darnel, the
    subjects of the evil one; the enemy who sowed them, the devil; the harvest
    is the end of the world; the reapers are the angels. Well then, just as the
    darnel is gathered up and burnt in the fire, so it will be at the end of
    time. The Son of Man will send his angels and they will gather out of his
    kingdom all things that provoke offences and all who do evil, and throw them
    into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
    Then the virtuous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.
    Listen, anyone who has ears!

    In Christ Jesus, you that used to be so far apart from us have been brought
    very close, by the blood of Christ. For he is the peace between us, and has
    made the two into one and broken down the barrier which used to keep them
    apart, actually destroying in his own person the hostility caused by the
    rules and decrees of the Law. This was to create one single New Man in
    himself out of the two of them and by restoring peace through the cross, to
    unite them both in a single Body and reconcile them with God; In his own
    person he killed the hostility. Later he came to bring the good news of
    peace, peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near at
    hand. Through him, both of us have in the one Spirit our way to come to the

    The apostles rejoined Jesus and told him all they had done and taught. Then
    he said to them, 'You must come away to some lonely place all by yourselves
    and rest for a while'; for there were so many coming and going that the
    apostles had no time even to eat. So they went off in a boat to a lonely
    place where they could be by themselves. But people saw them going, and many
    could guess where; and from every town they all hurried to the place on foot
    and reached it before them. So as he stepped ashore he saw a large crowd;
    and he took pity on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd,
    and he set himself to teach them at some length.

    The Lord appeared to Abraham at the Oak of Mamre while he was sitting by the
    entrance of the tent during the hottest part of the day. He looked up, and
    there he saw three men standing near him. As soon as he saw them he ran from
    the entrance of the tent to meet them and bowed to the ground. 'My lord,' he
    said 'I beg you, If I find favour with you kindly do not pass your servant
    by. A little water shall be brought; you shall wash your feet and lie down
    under the tree Let me fetch a little bread and you shall refresh yourselves
    before going further. That is why you have come in your servant's direction.
    They replied 'Do as you say'. Abraham hastened to the tent to find Sarah.
    'Hurry' he said 'knead three bushels of flour and make loaves.' Then running
    to the cattle Abraham took a fine and tender calf and gave it to the
    servant, who hurried to prepare it. Then taking cream, milk and the calf he
    had prepared, he laid all before them, and they ate while he remained
    standing near them under the tree. Where is your wife Sarah? they asked him.
    'She is in the tent' he replied. Then his guest said, 'I shall visit you

    When Pharaoh, king of Egypt, was told that the people had made their escape,
    he and his courtiers changed their minds about the people. 'What have we
    done,' they said 'allowing Israel &nbsp;to leave our service?' So Pharaoh
    had his chariot harnessed and gathered his troops about him,14:7 taking six
    hundred of the best chariots and all the other chariots in Egypt, each
    manned by a picked team. The Lord made Pharaoh, king of Egypt, stubborn, and
    he gave chase to the sons of Israel&nbsp; as they made their triumphant
    escape. So the Egyptians gave chase and came up with them where they lay
    encamped beside the sea - all the horses, the chariots of Pharaoh, his
    horsemen, his army - near Pi-hahiroth, facing Baal-zephon. And as Pharaoh
    approached, the sons of Israel &nbsp;looked round - and there were the
    Egyptians in pursuit of them! The sons of Israel &nbsp;were terrified and
    cried out to the Lord. To Moses they said, 'Were there no graves in Egypt
    that you must lead us out to die in the wilderness? What good have you done
    us, bringing us out of Egypt? We spoke of this in Egypt, did we not? Leave
    us alone, we said, we would rather work for the Egyptians! Better to work
    for the Egyptians than die in the wilderness!' Moses answered the people,
    'Have no fear! Stand firm, and you will see what the Lord will do to save
    you today: the Egyptians you see today, you will never see again. The Lord
    will do the fighting for you: you have only to keep still.' The Lord said to
    Moses, 'Why do you cry to me so? Tell the sons of Israel&nbsp; to march on.
    For yourself, raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and
    part it for the sons of Israel &nbsp;to walk through the sea on dry ground.
    I for my part will make the heart of the Egyptians so stubborn that they
    will follow them. So shall I win myself glory at the expense of Pharaoh, of
    all his army, his chariots, his horsemen. And when I have won glory for
    myself, at the expense of Pharaoh and his chariots and his army, the
    Egyptians will learn that I am the Lord.'

    Listen to what the Lord is saying: Stand up and let the case begin in the
    hearing of the mountains and let the hills hear what you say. Listen, you
    mountains, to the Lord's accusation, give ear, you foundations of the earth,
    for the Lord is accusing his people, pleading against Israel: My people,
    what have I done to you, how have I been a burden to you? Answer me. I
    brought you out of the land of Egypt, I rescued you from the house of
    slavery; I sent Moses to lead you, with Aaron and Miriam. - 'With what gift
    shall I come into the Lord's presence and bow down before God on high? Shall
    I come with holocausts, with calves one year old? Will he be pleased with
    rams by the thousand, with libations of oil in torrents? Must I give my
    first-born for what I have done wrong, the fruit of my body for my own sin?'
    - What is good has been explained to you, man; this is what the Lord asks of
    you: only this, to act justly, to love tenderly and to walk humbly with your

    Some of the scribes and Pharisees spoke up. 'Master,' they said 'we should
    like to see a sign from you.' Jesus replied, 'It is an evil and unfaithful
    generation that asks for a sign! The only sign it will be given is the sign
    of the prophet Jonah. For as Jonah was in the belly of the sea-monster for
    three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the
    earth for three days and three nights. On Judgment day the men of Nineveh
    will stand up with this generation and condemn it, because when Jonah
    preached they repented; and there is something greater than Jonah here. On
    Judgment day the Queen of the South will rise up with this generation and
    condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom
    of Solomon; and there is something greater than Solomon here.

    Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. The Lord drove back the sea with
    a strong easterly wind all night, and he made dry land of the sea. The
    waters parted and the sons of Israel went on dry ground right into the sea,
    walls of water to right and to left of them. The Egyptians gave chase: after
    them they went, right into the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and
    his horsemen. In the morning watch, the Lord looked down on the army of the
    Egyptians from the pillar of fire and of cloud, and threw the army into
    confusion. He so clogged their chariot wheels that they could scarcely make
    headway. 'Let us flee from the Israelites,' the Egyptians cried 'the Lord is
    fighting for them against the Egyptians!' 'Stretch out your hand over the
    sea,' the Lord said to Moses 'that the waters may flow back on the Egyptians
    and their chariots and their horsemen.' Moses stretched out his hand over
    the sea and, as day broke, the sea returned to its bed. The fleeing
    Egyptians marched right into it, and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the
    very middle of the sea. The returning waters overwhelmed the chariots and
    the horsemen of Pharaoh's whole army, which had followed the Israelites into
    the sea; not a single one of them was left. But the sons of Israel had
    marched through the sea on dry ground, walls of water to right and to left
    of them. That day, the Lord rescued Israel from the Egyptians, and Israel
    saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore. Israel witnessed the great act
    that the Lord had performed against the Egyptians, and the people venerated
    the Lord; they put their faith in the Lord and in Moses, his servant. It was
    then that Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song in honour of the Lord:

    From Elim they set out again, and the whole community of the sons of Israel
    reached the wilderness of Sin - between Elim and Sinai - on the fifteenth
    day of the second month after they had left Egypt. And the whole community
    of the sons of Israel began to complain against Moses and Aaron in the
    wilderness and said to them, 'Why did we not die at the Lord's hand in the
    land of Egypt, when we were able to sit down to pans of meat and could eat
    bread to our heart's content! As it is, you have brought us to this
    wilderness to starve this whole company to death!' Then the Lord said to
    Moses, 'Now I will rain down bread for you from the heavens. Each day the
    people are to go out and gather the day's portion; I propose to test them in
    this way to see whether they will follow my law or not. On the sixth day,
    when they prepare what they have brought in, this will be twice as much as
    the daily gathering.' Moses said to Aaron, 'To the whole community of the
    sons of Israel say this, "Present yourselves before the Lord, for he has
    heard your complaints"'. As Aaron was speaking to the whole community of the
    sons of Israel, they turned towards the wilderness, and there was the glory
    of the Lord appearing in the form of a cloud. Then the Lord spoke to Moses
    and said, 'I have heard the complaints of the sons of Israel. Say this to
    them, "Between the two evenings you shall eat meat, and in the morning you
    shall have bread to your heart's content. Then you will learn that I, the
    Lord, am your God."' And so it came about: quails flew up in the evening,
    and they covered the camp; in the morning there was a coating of dew all
    round the camp. When the coating of dew lifted, there on the surface of the
    desert was a thing delicate, powdery, as fine as hoarfrost on the ground.
    When they saw this, the sons of Israel said to one another, 'What is that?'
    not knowing what it was. 'That' said Moses to them 'is the bread the Lord
    gives you to eat.

    That same day, Jesus left the house and sat by the lakeside, but such large
    crowds gathered round him that he got into a boat and sat there. The people
    all stood on the beach, and he told them many things in parables. He said,
    'Imagine a sower going out to sow. As he sowed, some seeds fell on the edge
    of the path, and the birds came and ate them up. Others fell on patches of
    rock where they found little soil and sprang up straight away, because there
    was no depth of earth; but as soon as the sun came up they were scorched
    and, not having any roots, they withered away. Others fell among thorns, and
    the thorns grew up and choked them. Others fell on rich soil and produced
    their crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. Listen, anyone who
    has ears!'

    Three months after they came out of the land of Egypt, on that day the sons
    of Israel came to the wilderness of Sinai. From Rephidim they set out again;
    and when they reached the wilderness of Sinai, there in the wilderness they
    pitched their camp; there facing the mountain Israel pitched camp. The Lord
    said to Moses, 'I am coming to you in a dense cloud so that the people may
    hear when I speak to you and may trust you always'. And Moses took the
    people's reply back to the Lord. The Lord said to Moses, 'Go to the people
    and tell them to prepare themselves today and tomorrow. Let them wash their
    clothing and hold themselves in readiness for the third day, because on the
    third day the Lord will descend on the mountain of Sinai in the sight of all
    the people. Now at daybreak on the third day there were peals of thunder on
    the mountain and lightning flashes, a dense cloud, and a loud trumpet blast,
    and inside the camp all the people trembled. Then Moses led the people out
    of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the bottom of the mountain. The
    mountain of Sinai was entirely wrapped in smoke, because the Lord had
    descended on it in the form of fire. Like smoke from a furnace the smoke
    went up, and the whole mountain shook violently. Louder and louder grew the
    sound of the trumpet. Moses spoke, and God answered him with peals of
    thunder. The Lord came down on the mountain of Sinai, on the mountain top,
    and the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain.

    The word of the Lord was addressed to me, saying, 'Go and shout this in the
    hearing of Jerusalem: "The Lord says this: I remember the affection of your
    youth, the love of your bridal days: you followed me through the wilderness,
    through a land unsown. Israel was sacred to the Lord, the first-fruits of
    his harvest; anyone who ate of this had to pay for it, misfortune came to
    them - it is the Lord who speaks."' I brought you to a fertile country to
    enjoy its produce and good things; but no sooner had you entered than you
    defiled my land, and made my heritage detestable. The priests have never
    asked, "Where is the Lord?" Those who administer the Law have no knowledge
    of me. The shepherds have rebelled against me; the prophets have prophesied
    in the name of Baal, following things with no power in them. You heavens,
    stand aghast at this, stand stupefied, stand utterly appalled - it is the
    Lord who speaks. Since my people have committed a double crime: they have
    abandoned me, the fountain of living water, only to dig cisterns for
    themselves, leaky cisterns that hold no water.

    The disciples went up to Jesus and asked, 'Why do you talk to them in
    parables?' 'Because' he replied 'the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven are
    revealed to you, but they are not revealed to them. For anyone who has will
    be given more, and he will have more than enough; but from anyone who has
    not, even what he has will be taken away. The reason I talk to them in
    parables is that they look without seeing and listen without hearing or
    understanding. So in their case this prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled:
    You will listen and listen again, but not understand, see and see again, but
    not perceive. For the heart of this nation has grown coarse, their ears are
    dull of hearing, and they have shut their eyes, for fear they should see
    with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and be
    converted and be healed by me. 'But happy are your eyes because they see,
    your ears because they hear! I tell you solemnly, many prophets and holy men
    longed to see what you see, and never saw it; to hear what you hear, and
    never heard it.

    God spoke all these words. He said, 'I am the Lord your God who brought you
    out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. 'You shall have no
    gods except me. 'You shall not make yourself a carved image or any likeness
    of anything in heaven or on earth beneath or in the waters under the earth;
    you shall not bow down to them or serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a
    jealous God and I punish the father's fault in the sons, the grandsons, and
    the great-grandsons of those who hate me; but I show kindness to thousands
    of those who love me and keep my commandments. 'You shall not utter the name
    of the Lord your God to misuse it, for the Lord will not leave unpunished
    the man who utters his name to misuse it. Remember the sabbath day and keep
    it holy. For six days you shall labour and do all your work, but the seventh
    day is a sabbath for the Lord your God. You shall do no work that day,
    neither you nor your son nor your daughter nor your servants, men or women,
    nor your animals nor the stranger who lives with you. For in six days the
    Lord made the heavens and the earth and the sea and all that these hold, but
    on the seventh day he rested; that is why the lord has blessed the sabbath
    day and made it sacred. 'Honour your father and your mother so that you may
    have a long life in the land that the Lord your God has given to you. 'You
    shall not kill. 'You shall not commit adultery. 'You shall not steal. 'You

    evil one comes and carries off what was sown in his heart: this is the man
    who received the seed on the edge of the path. The one who received it on
    patches of rock is the man who hears the word and welcomes it at once with
    joy. But he has no root in him, he does not last; let some trial come, or
    some persecution on account of the word, and he falls away at once. The one
    who received the seed in thorns is the man who hears the word, but the
    worries of this world and the lure of riches choke the word and so he
    produces nothing. And the one who received the seed in rich soil is the man
    who hears the word and understands it; he is the one who yields a harvest

    amend your behaviour and your actions, if you treat each other fairly,7:6 if
    you do not exploit the stranger, the orphan and the widow (if you do not
    shed innocent blood in this place), and if you do not follow alien gods, to
    your own ruin, then here in this place I will stay with you, in the land
    that long ago I gave to your fathers for ever. Yet here you are, trusting in
    delusive words, to no purpose! Steal, would you, murder, commit adultery,
    perjure yourselves, burn incense to Baal, follow alien gods that you do not
    know? - and then come presenting yourselves in this Temple that bears my
    name, saying: Now we are safe - safe to go on committing all these
    abominations! Do you take this Temple that bears my name for a robbers' den?
    I, at any rate, am not blind - it is the Lord who speaks.

    Jesus put a parable before the crowds, 'The kingdom of heaven may be
    compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field. While everybody was
    asleep his enemy came, sowed darnel all among the wheat, and made off. When
    the new wheat sprouted and ripened, the darnel appeared as well. The owner's
    servants went to him and said, "Sir, was it not good seed that you sowed in
    your field? If so, where does the darnel come from?" "Some enemy has done
    this" he answered. And the servants said, "Do you want us to go and weed it
    out?" But he said, "No, because when you weed out the darnel you might pull
    up the wheat with it. Let them both grow till the harvest; and at harvest
    time I shall say to the reapers: First collect the darnel and tie it in
    bundles to be burnt, then gather the wheat into my barn."'
