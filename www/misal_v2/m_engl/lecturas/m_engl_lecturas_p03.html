    On the day of Pentecost Peter stood up with the Eleven and addressed them in
    a loud voice: 'Men of Judaea, and all you who live in Jerusalem, make no
    mistake about this, but listen carefully to what I say. Jesus the Nazarene
    was a man commended to you by God by the miracles and portents and signs
    that God worked through him when he was among you, as you all know. This
    man, who was put into your power by the deliberate intention and
    foreknowledge of God, you took and had crucified by men outside the Law. You
    killed him, but God raised him to life, freeing him from the pangs of Hades;
    for it was impossible for him to be held in its power since, as David says
    of him: I saw the Lord before me always, for with him at my right hand
    nothing can shake me. So my heart was glad and my tongue cried out with joy;
    my body, too, will rest in the hope that you will not abandon my soul to
    Hades nor allow your holy one to experience corruption. You have made known
    the way of life to me, you will fill me with gladness through your presence.
    'Brothers, no one can deny that the patriarch David himself is dead and
    buried: his tomb is still with us. But since he was a prophet, and knew that
    God had sworn him an oath to make one of his descendants succeed him on the
    throne, 'what he foresaw and spoke about was the resurrection of the Christ:
    he is the one who was not abandoned to Hades, and whose body did not
    experience corruption. God raised this man Jesus to life, and all of us are
    witnesses to that. Now raised to the heights by God's right hand, he has
    received from the Father the Holy Spirit, who was promised, and what you see
    and hear is the outpouring of that Spirit.

    If you are acknowledging as your Father one who has no favourites and judges
    everyone according to what he has done, you must be scrupulously careful as
    long as you are living away from your home. Remember, the ransom that was
    paid to free you from the useless way of life your ancestors handed down was
    not paid in anything corruptible, neither in silver nor gold, but in the
    precious blood of a lamb without spot or stain, namely Christ; who, though
    known since before the world was made, has been revealed only in our time,
    the end of the ages, for your sake. Through him you now have faith in God,
    who raised him from the dead and gave him glory for that very reason - so
    that you would have faith and hope in God.

    Two of the disciples of Jesus were on their way to a village called Emmaus,
    seven miles from Jerusalem, and they were talking together about all that
    had happened. Now as they talked this over, Jesus himself came up and walked
    by their side; but something prevented them from recognising him. He said to
    them, 'What matters are you discussing as you walk along?' They stopped
    short, their faces downcast. Then one of them, called Cleopas, answered him,
    'You must be the only person staying in Jerusalem who does not know the
    things that have been happening there these last few days'. 'What things?'
    he asked. 'All about Jesus of Nazareth' they answered 'who proved he was a
    great prophet by the things he said and did in the sight of God and of the
    whole people; and how our chief priests and our leaders handed him over to
    be sentenced to death, and had him crucified. Our own hope had been that he
    would be the one to set Israel free. And this is not all: two whole days
    have gone by since it all happened; and some women from our group have
    astounded us: they went to the tomb in the early morning, and when they did
    not find the body, they came back to tell us they had seen a vision of
    angels who declared he was alive. Some of our friends went to the tomb and
    found everything exactly as the women had reported, but of him they saw
    nothing.' Then he said to them, 'You foolish men! So slow to believe the
    full message of the prophets! Was it not ordained that the Christ should
    suffer and so enter&nbsp; into his glory?' Then, starting with Moses and
    going through all the prophets, he explained to them the passages throughout
    the scriptures that were about himself. When they drew near to the village
    to which they were going, he made as if to go on; but they pressed him to
    stay with them. 'It is nearly evening' they said 'and the day is almost
    over.' So he went in to stay with them. Now while he was with them at table,
    he took the bread and said the blessing; then he broke it and handed it to
    them. And their eyes were opened and they recognised him; but he had
    vanished from their sight. Then they said to each other, 'Did not our hearts
    burn within us as he talked to us on the road and explained the scriptures
    to us?' They set out that instant and returned to Jerusalem. There they
    found the Eleven assembled together with their companions, who said to them,
    'Yes, it is true. The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.' Then they
    told their story of what had happened on the road and how they had
    recognised him at the breaking of bread.

    Peter said to the people: 'You are Israelites, and it is the God of Abraham,
    Isaac and Jacob, the God of our ancestors, who has glorified his servant
    Jesus, the same Jesus you handed over and then disowned in the presence of
    Pilate after Pilate had decided to release him. It was you who accused the
    Holy One, the Just One, you who demanded the reprieve of a murderer while
    you killed the prince of life. God, however, raised him from the dead, and
    to that fact we are the witnesses; Now I know, brothers, that neither you
    nor your leaders had any idea what you were really doing; this was the way
    God carried out what he had foretold, when he said through all his prophets
    that his Christ would suffer. Now you must repent and turn to God, so that
    your sins may be wiped out.'

    The disciples told their story of what had happened on the road and how they
    had recognised Jesus at the breaking of bread. They were still talking about
    all this when Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, 'Peace be
    with you!' In a state of alarm and fright, they thought they were seeing a
    ghost. But he said, 'Why are you so agitated, and why are these doubts
    rising in your hearts? Look at my hands and feet; yes, it is I indeed. Touch
    me and see for yourselves; a ghost has no flesh and bones as you can see I
    have.' And as he said this he showed them his hands and feet. Their joy was
    so great that they still could not believe it, and they stood there
    dumbfounded; so he said to them, 'Have you anything here to eat?' And they
    offered him a piece of grilled fish, which he took and ate before their
    eyes. Then he told them, 'This is what I meant when I said, while I was
    still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses, in the
    Prophets and in the Psalms has to be fulfilled'. He then opened their minds
    to understand the scriptures, and he said to them, 'So you see how it is
    written that the Christ would suffer and on the third day rise from the
    dead, and that, in his name, repentance for the forgiveness of sins would be
    preached to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses to
    this.'

    The high priest demanded an explanation of the apostles. 'We gave you a
    formal warning' he said 'not to preach in this name, and what have you done?
    You have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and seem determined to fix the
    guilt of this man's death on us.' In reply Peter and the apostles said,
    'Obedience to God comes before obedience to men; it was the God of our
    ancestors who raised up Jesus, but it was you who had him executed by
    hanging on a tree. By his own right hand God has now raised him up to be
    leader and saviour, to give repentance and forgiveness of sins through him
    to Israel. We are witnesses to all this, we and the Holy Spirit whom God has
    given to those who obey him.' They warned the apostles not to speak in the
    name of Jesus and released them. And so they left the presence of the
    Sanhedrin glad to have had the honour of suffering humiliation for the sake
    of the name.

    Jesus showed himself again to the disciples. It was by the Sea of Tiberias,
    and it happened like this: Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael
    from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee and two more of his disciples were
    together. Simon Peter said, 'I'm going fishing'. They replied, 'We'll come
    with you'. They went out and got into the boat but caught nothing that
    night. It was light by now and there stood Jesus on the shore, though the
    disciples did not realise that it was Jesus. Jesus called out, 'Have you
    caught anything, friends?' And when they answered, 'No', he said, 'Throw the
    net out to starboard and you'll find something'. So they dropped the net,
    and there were so many fish that they could not haul it in. The disciple
    Jesus loved said to Peter, 'It is the Lord'. At these words 'It is the
    Lord', Simon Peter, who had practically nothing on, wrapped his cloak round
    him and jumped into the water. The other disciples came on in the boat,
    towing the net and the fish; they were only about a hundred yards from land.
    As soon as they came ashore they saw that there was some bread there, and a
    charcoal fire with fish cooking on it. Jesus said, 'Bring some of the fish
    you have just caught'. Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net to the
    shore, full of big fish, one hundred and fifty-three of them; and in spite
    of there being so many the net was not broken. Jesus said to them, 'Come and
    have breakfast'. None of the disciples was bold enough to ask, 'Who are
    you?'; they knew quite well it was the Lord. Jesus then stepped forward,
    took the bread and gave it to them, and the same with the fish. This was the
    third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after rising from the
    dead. After the meal Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon son of John, do you
    love me more than these others do?' He answered, 'Yes Lord, you know I love
    you'. Jesus said to him, 'Feed my lambs'. A second time he said to him,
    'Simon son of John, do you love me?' He replied, 'Yes, Lord, you know I love
    you'. Jesus said to him, 'Look after my sheep'. Then he said to him a third
    time, 'Simon son of John, do you love me?' Peter was upset that he asked him
    the third time, 'Do you love me?' and said, 'Lord, you know everything; you
    know I love you'. Jesus said to him, 'Feed my sheep. 'I tell you most
    solemnly, when you were young you put on your own belt and walked where you
    liked; but when you grow old you will stretch out your hands, and somebody
    else will put a belt round you and take you where you would rather not go.'
    In these words he indicated the kind of death by which Peter would give
    glory to God. After this he said, 'Follow me'.

    Jesus showed himself again to the disciples. It was by the Sea of Tiberias,
    and it happened like this: Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael
    from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee and two more of his disciples were
    together. Simon Peter said, 'I'm going fishing'. They replied, 'We'll come
    with you'. They went out and got into the boat but caught nothing that
    night. It was light by now and there stood Jesus on the shore, though the
    disciples did not realise that it was Jesus. Jesus called out, 'Have you
    caught anything, friends?' And when they answered, 'No', he said, 'Throw the
    net out to starboard and you'll find something'. So they dropped the net,
    and there were so many fish that they could not haul it in. The disciple
    Jesus loved said to Peter, 'It is the Lord'. At these words 'It is the
    Lord', Simon Peter, who had practically nothing on, wrapped his cloak round
    him and jumped into the water. The other disciples came on in the boat,
    towing the net and the fish; they were only about a hundred yards from land.
    As soon as they came ashore they saw that there was some bread there, and a
    charcoal fire with fish cooking on it. Jesus said, 'Bring some of the fish
    you have just caught'. Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net to the
    shore, full of big fish, one hundred and fifty-three of them; and in spite
    of there being so many the net was not broken. Jesus said to them, 'Come and
    have breakfast'. None of the disciples was bold enough to ask, 'Who are
    you?'; they knew quite well it was the Lord. Jesus then stepped forward,
    took the bread and gave it to them, and the same with the fish. This was the
    third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after rising from the
    dead.

    Stephen was filled with grace and power and began to work miracles and great
    signs among the people. But then certain people came forward to debate with
    Stephen, some from Cyrene and Alexandria who were members of the synagogue
    called the Synagogue of Freedmen, and others from Cilicia and Asia. They
    found they could not get the better of him because of his wisdom, and
    because it was the Spirit that prompted what he said. So they procured some
    men to say, 'We heard him using blasphemous language against Moses and
    against God'. Having in this way turned the people against him as well as
    the elders and scribes, they took Stephen by surprise, and arrested him and
    brought him before the Sanhedrin. There they put up false witnesses to say,
    'This man is always making speeches against this Holy Place and the Law. We
    have heard him say that Jesus the Nazarene is going to destroy this Place
    and alter the traditions that Moses handed down to us.' The members of the
    Sanhedrin all looked intently at Stephen, and his face appeared to them like
    the face of an angel.

    After Jesus had fed the five thousand, his disciples saw him walking on the
    water. Next day, the crowd that had stayed on the other side saw that only
    one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not got into the boat with his
    disciples, but that the disciples had set off by themselves. Other boats,
    however, had put in from Tiberias, near the place where the bread had been
    eaten. When the people saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there,
    they got into those boats and crossed to Capernaum to look for Jesus. When
    they found him on the other side, they said to him, 'Rabbi, when did you
    come here?' Jesus answered: 'I tell you most solemnly, you are not looking
    for me because you have seen the signs but because you had all the bread you
    wanted to eat. Do not work for food that cannot last, but work for food that
    endures to eternal life, the kind of food the Son of Man is offering you,
    for on him the Father, God himself, has set his seal.' Then they said to
    him, 'What must we do if we are to do the works that God wants?' Jesus gave
    them this answer, 'This is working for God: you must believe in the one he
    has sent'.

    Stephen said to the people, the elders and the scribes: 'You stubborn
    people, with your pagan hearts and pagan ears. You are always resisting the
    Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors used to do. Can you name a single
    prophet your ancestors never persecuted? In the past they killed those who
    foretold the coming of the Just One, and now you have become his betrayers,
    his murderers. You who had the Law brought to you by angels are the very
    ones who have not kept it.' They were infuriated when they heard this, and
    ground their teeth at him. But Stephen, filled with the Holy Spirit, gazed
    into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at God's right
    hand. 'I can see heaven thrown open' he said 'and the Son of Man standing at
    the right hand of God.' At this all the members of the council shouted out
    and stopped their ears with their hands; then they all rushed at him, sent
    him out of the city and stoned him. The witnesses put down their clothes at
    the feet of a young man called Saul. As they were stoning him, Stephen said
    in invocation, 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit'. Then he knelt down and said
    aloud, 'Lord, do not hold this sin against them'; and with these words he
    fell asleep. Saul entirely approved of the killing.

    The people said to Jesus: 'What sign will you give to show us that we should

    That day a bitter persecution started against the church in Jerusalem, and
    everyone except the apostles fled to the country districts of Judaea and
    Samaria. There were some devout people, however, who buried Stephen and made
    great mourning for him. Saul then worked for the total destruction of the
    Church; he went from house to house arresting both men and women and sending
    them to prison. Those who had escaped went from place to place preaching the
    Good News. One of them was Philip who went to a Samaritan town and
    proclaimed the Christ to them. The people united in welcoming the message
    Philip preached, either because they had heard of the miracles he worked or
    because they saw them for themselves. There were, for example, unclean
    spirits that came shrieking out of many who were possessed, and several
    paralytics and cripples were cured. As a result there was great rejoicing in
    that town.

    The angel of the Lord spoke to Philip saying, 'Be ready to set out at noon
    along the road that goes from Jerusalem down to Gaza, the desert road'. So
    he set off on his journey. Now it happened that an Ethiopian had been on
    pilgrimage to Jerusalem; he was a eunuch and an officer at the court of the
    kandake, or queen, of Ethiopia, and was in fact her chief treasurer. He was
    now on his way home; and as he sat in his chariot he was reading the prophet
    Isaiah. The Spirit said to Philip, 'Go up and meet that chariot'. When
    Philip ran up, he heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, 'Do you
    understand what you are reading?' 'How can I' he replied 'unless I have
    someone to guide me?' So he invited Philip to get in and sit by his side.
    Now the passage of scripture he was reading was this: Like a sheep that is
    led to the slaughter-house, like a lamb that is dumb in front of its
    shearers, like these he never opens his mouth.&nbsp; He has been humiliated
    and has no one to defend him. Who will ever talk about his descendants,
    since his life on earth has been cut short! The eunuch turned to Philip and
    said, 'Tell me, is the prophet referring to himself or someone else?'
    Starting, therefore, with this text of scripture Philip proceeded to explain
    the Good News of Jesus to him. Further along the road they came to some
    water, and the eunuch said, 'Look, there is some water here; is there
    anything to stop me being baptised?' He ordered the chariot to stop, then
    Philip and the eunuch both went down into the water and Philip baptised him.
    But after they had come up out of the water again Philip was taken away by
    the Spirit of the Lord, and the eunuch never saw him again but went on his
    way rejoicing. Philip found that he had reached Azotus and continued his
    journey proclaiming the Good News in every town as far as Caesarea.

  <p class="Areadingfrom">
    Saul was still breathing threats to slaughter the Lord's disciples. He had
    gone to the high priest and asked for letters addressed to the synagogues in
    Damascus, that would authorise him to arrest and take to Jerusalem any
    followers of the Way, men or women, that he could find. Suddenly, while he
    was travelling to Damascus and just before he reached the city, there came a
    light from heaven all round him. He fell to the ground, and then he heard a
    voice saying, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?' 'Who are you, Lord?'
    he asked, and the voice answered, 'I am Jesus, and you are persecuting me.
    Get up now and go into the city, and you will be told what you have to do.'
    The men travelling with Saul stood there speechless, for though they heard
    the voice they could see no one. Saul got up from the ground, but even with
    his eyes wide open he could see nothing at all, and they had to lead him
    into Damascus by the hand. For three days he was without his sight, and took
    neither food nor drink. A disciple called Ananias who lived in Damascus had
    a vision in which he heard the Lord say to him, 'Ananias!' When he replied,
    'Here I am, Lord', the Lord said, 'You must go to Straight Street and ask at
    the house of Judas for someone called Saul, who comes from Tarsus. At this
    moment he is praying, having had a vision of a man called Ananias coming in
    and laying hands on him to give him back his sight.' When he heard that,
    Ananias said, 'Lord, several people have told me about this man and all the
    harm he has been doing to your saints in Jerusalem. He has only come here
    because he holds a warrant from the chief priests to arrest everybody who
    invokes your name.' The Lord replied, 'You must go all the same, because
    this man is my chosen instrument to bring my name before pagans and pagan
    kings and before the people of Israel;&nbsp; I myself will show him how much
    he himself must suffer for my name'. Then Ananias went. He entered the
    house, and at once laid his hands on Saul and said, 'Brother Saul, I have
    been sent by the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on your way here so that you
    may recover your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit'. Immediately it
    was as though scales fell away from Saul's eyes and he could see again. So
    he was baptised there and then, and after taking some food he regained his
    strength. After he had spent only a few days with the disciples in Damascus,
    he began preaching in the synagogues, 'Jesus is the Son of God'.

    The Jews started arguing with one another: 'How can this man give us his
    flesh to eat?' they said. Jesus replied: 'I tell you most solemnly, if you
    do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not
    have life in you. Anyone who does eat my flesh and drink my blood has
    eternal life, and I shall raise him up on the last day. For my flesh is real
    food and my blood is real drink. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood
    lives in me and I live in him. As I, who am sent by the living Father,
    myself draw life from the Father, so whoever eats me will draw life from me.
    This is the bread come down from heaven; not like the bread our ancestors
    ate: they are dead, but anyone who eats this bread will live for ever.' He
    taught this doctrine at Capernaum, in the synagogue.

    The churches throughout Judaea, Galilee and Samaria were now left in peace,
    building themselves up, living in the fear of the Lord, and filled with the
    consolation of the Holy Spirit. Peter visited one place after another and
    eventually came to the saints living down in Lydda. There he found a man
    called Aeneas, a paralytic who had been bedridden for eight years. Peter
    said to him, 'Aeneas, Jesus Christ cures you: get up and fold up your
    sleeping mat'. Aeneas got up immediately; everybody who lived in Lydda and
    Sharon saw him, and they were all converted to the Lord. At Jaffa there was
    a woman disciple called Tabitha, or Dorcas in Greek, who never tired of
    doing good or giving in charity. But the time came when she got ill and
    died, and they washed her and laid her out in a room upstairs. Lydda is not
    far from Jaffa, so when the disciples heard that Peter was there, they sent
    two men with an urgent message for him, 'Come and visit us as soon as
    possible'. Peter went back with them straightaway, and on his arrival they
    took him to the upstairs room, where all the widows stood round him in
    tears, showing him tunics and other clothes Dorcas had made when she was
    with them. Peter sent them all out of the room and knelt down and prayed.
    Then he turned to the dead woman and said, 'Tabitha, stand up'. She opened
    her eyes, looked at Peter and sat up. Peter helped her to her feet, then he
    called in the saints and widows and showed them she was alive. The whole of
    Jaffa heard about it and many believed in the Lord.

    After hearing his doctrine, many of the followers of Jesus said, 'This is
    intolerable language. How could anyone accept it?' Jesus was aware that his
    followers were complaining about it and said, 'Does this upset you? What if
    you should see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before?&nbsp;'It is the
    spirit that gives life, the flesh has nothing to offer. The words I have
    spoken to you are spirit and they are life.&nbsp;'But there are some of you
    who do not believe.' For Jesus knew from the outset those who did not
    believe, and who it was that would betray him. He went on, 'This is why I
    told you that no one could come to me unless the Father allows him'. After
    this, many of his disciples left him and stopped going with him. Then Jesus
    said to the Twelve, 'What about you, do you want to go away too?' Simon
    Peter answered, 'Lord, who shall we go to? You have the message of eternal
    life, and we believe; we know that you are the Holy One of God.'
