    On this mountain, the Lord of hosts will prepare for all peoples a banquet
    of rich food, a banquet of fine wines, of food rich and juicy, of fine
    strained wines. &nbsp;On this mountain he will remove the mourning veil
    covering all peoples, and the shroud enwrapping all nations, &nbsp;he will
    destroy Death for ever. The Lord will wipe away the tears from every cheek;
    he will take away his people's shame everywhere on earth, for the Lord has
    said so. &nbsp;That day, it will be said: See, this is our God in whom we
    hoped for salvation; the Lord is the one in whom we hoped. We exult and we
    rejoice that he has saved us; &nbsp;for the hand of the Lord rests on this

    At that time Jesus began to speak in parables once again to the chief
    priests and elders of the people: &nbsp;'The kingdom of heaven may be
    compared to a king who gave a feast for his son's wedding. &nbsp;He sent his
    servants to call those who had been invited, but they would not come.
    &nbsp;Next he sent some more servants. "Tell those who have been invited" he
    said "that I have my banquet all prepared, my oxen and fattened cattle have
    been slaughtered, everything is ready. Come to the wedding." &nbsp;But they
    were not interested: one went off to his farm, another to his business,
    &nbsp;and the rest seized his servants, maltreated them and killed them.
    &nbsp;The king was furious. He despatched his troops, destroyed those
    murderers and burnt their town. &nbsp;Then he said to his servants, "The
    wedding is ready; but as those who were invited proved to be unworthy,
    &nbsp;go to the crossroads in the town and invite everyone you can find to
    the wedding". &nbsp;So these servants went out on to the roads and collected
    together everyone they could find, bad and good alike; and the wedding hall
    was filled with guests. &nbsp;When the king came in to look at the guests he
    noticed one man who was not wearing a wedding garment, &nbsp;and said to
    him, "How did you get in here, my friend, without a wedding garment?" And
    the man was silent. &nbsp;Then the king said to the attendants, "Bind him
    hand and foot and throw him out into the dark, where there will be weeping
    and grinding of teeth". &nbsp;For many are called, but few are chosen.'

    Jesus was setting out on a journey when a man ran up, knelt before him and
    put this question to him, 'Good master, what must I do to inherit eternal
    life?' &nbsp;Jesus said to him, 'Why do you call me good? No one is good but
    God alone. &nbsp;You know the commandments: You must not kill; You must not
    commit adultery; You must not steal; You must not bring false witness; You
    must not defraud; Honour your father and mother.' &nbsp;And he said to him,
    'Master, I have kept all these from my earliest days'. &nbsp;Jesus looked
    steadily at him and loved him, and he said, 'There is one thing you lack. Go
    and sell everything you own and give the money to the poor, and you will
    have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.' &nbsp;But his face fell at
    these words and he went away sad, for he was a man of great wealth.
    &nbsp;Jesus looked round and said to his disciples, 'How hard it is for
    those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!' &nbsp;The disciples were
    astounded by these words, but Jesus insisted, 'My children,' he said to them
    'how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! &nbsp;It is easier for a camel
    to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom
    of God.' &nbsp;They were more astonished than ever. 'In that case' they said
    to one another 'who can be saved?' &nbsp;Jesus gazed at them. 'For men' he
    said 'it is impossible, but not for God: because everything is possible for
    God.' &nbsp;Peter took this up. 'What about us?' he asked him. 'We have left
    everything and followed you.' &nbsp;Jesus said, 'I tell you solemnly, there
    is no one who has left house, brothers, sisters, father, children or land
    for my sake and for the sake of the gospel &nbsp;who will not be repaid a
    hundred times over, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and land -
    not without persecutions - now in this present time and, in the world to

    On the way to Jerusalem Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and
    Galilee. &nbsp;As he entered one of the villages, ten lepers came to meet
    him. They stood some way off &nbsp;and called to him, 'Jesus! Master! Take
    pity on us.' &nbsp;When he saw them he said, 'Go and show yourselves to the
    priests'. Now as they were going away they were cleansed. &nbsp;Finding
    himself cured, one of them turned back praising God at the top of his voice
    &nbsp;and threw himself at the feet of Jesus and thanked him. The man was a
    Samaritan. &nbsp;This made Jesus say, 'Were not all ten made clean? The
    other nine, where are they? &nbsp;It seems that no one has come back to give
    praise to God, except this foreigner.' &nbsp;And he said to the man, 'Stand
    up and go on your way. Your faith has saved you.'

    of God who, according to the human nature he took was a descendant of David:
    &nbsp;it is about Jesus Christ our Lord who, in the order of the spirit, the
    spirit of holiness that was in him, was proclaimed Son of God in all his
    power through his resurrection from the dead. &nbsp;Through him we received
    grace and our apostolic mission to preach the obedience of faith to all
    pagan nations in honour of his name. &nbsp;You are one of these nations, and
    by his call belong to Jesus Christ. &nbsp;To you all, then, who are God's
    beloved in Rome, called to be saints, may God our Father and the Lord Jesus
    Christ send grace and peace.

    The Law says, if you remember, that Abraham had two sons, one by the
    slave-girl, and one by his free-born wife. &nbsp;The child of the slave-girl
    was born in the ordinary way; the child of the free woman was born as the
    result of a promise. &nbsp;This can be regarded as an allegory: the women
    stand for the two covenants. The first who comes from Mount Sinai, and whose
    children are slaves, is Hagar. &nbsp;The Jerusalem above, however, is free
    and is our mother, since scripture says: Shout for joy, you barren women who
    bore no children! Break into shouts of joy and gladness, you who were never
    in labour. For there are more sons of the forsaken one than sons of the
    wedded wife. &nbsp;So, my brothers, we are the children, not of the
    slave-girl, but of the free-born wife. &nbsp;When Christ freed us, he meant
    us to remain free. Stand firm, therefore, and do not submit again to the
    yoke of slavery.

    The crowds got even bigger and Jesus addressed them, 'This is a wicked

    sign of Jonah. &nbsp;For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so
    will the Son of Man be to this generation. &nbsp;On Judgment day the Queen
    of the South will rise up with the men of this generation and condemn them,

    I am not ashamed of the Good News: it is the power of God saving all who
    have faith - Jews first, but Greeks as well - &nbsp;since this is what
    reveals the justice of God to us: it shows how faith leads to faith, or as
    scripture says: The upright man finds life through faith. &nbsp;The anger of
    God is being revealed from heaven against all the impiety and depravity of
    men who keep truth imprisoned in their wickedness. &nbsp;For what can be
    known about God is perfectly plain to them since God himself has made it
    plain. &nbsp;Ever since God created the world his everlasting power and
    deity - however invisible - have been there for the mind to see in the
    things he has made. That is why such people are without excuse: &nbsp;they
    knew God and yet refused to honour him as God or to thank him; instead, they
    made nonsense out of logic and their empty minds were darkened. &nbsp;The
    more they called themselves philosophers, the more stupid they grew,
    &nbsp;until they exchanged the glory of the immortal God for a worthless
    imitation, for the image of mortal man, of birds, of quadrupeds and

    practices with which they dishonour their own bodies, &nbsp;since they have
    given up divine truth for a lie and have worshipped and served creatures
    instead of the creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen!

    When Christ freed us, he meant us to remain free. Stand firm, therefore, and
    do not submit again to the yoke of slavery. &nbsp;It is I, Paul, who tell
    you this: if you allow yourselves to be circumcised, Christ will be of no
    benefit to you at all. &nbsp;With all solemnity I repeat my warning:
    Everyone who accepts circumcision is obliged to keep the whole Law.
    &nbsp;But if you do look to the Law to make you justified, then you have
    separated yourselves from Christ, and have fallen from grace.
    &nbsp;Christians are told by the Spirit to look to faith for those rewards
    that righteousness hopes for, &nbsp;since in Christ Jesus whether you are
    circumcised or not makes no difference - what matters is faith that makes
    its power felt through love.

    No matter who you are, if you pass judgment you have no excuse. In judging
    others you condemn yourself, since you behave no differently from those you
    judge. &nbsp;We know that God condemns that sort of behaviour impartially:
    &nbsp;and when you judge those who behave like this while you are doing
    exactly the same, do you think you will escape God's judgment? &nbsp;Or are
    you abusing his abundant goodness, patience and toleration, not realising
    that this goodness of God is meant to lead you to repentance? &nbsp;Your
    stubborn refusal to repent is only adding to the anger God will have towards
    you on that day of anger when his just judgments will be made known.
    &nbsp;He will repay each one as his works deserve. &nbsp;For those who
    sought renown and honour and immortality by always doing good there will be
    eternal life; &nbsp;for the unsubmissive who refused to take truth for their
    guide and took depravity instead, there will be anger and fury. &nbsp;Pain

    If you are led by the Spirit, no law can touch you. &nbsp;When
    self-indulgence is at work the results are obvious: fornication, gross

    God's justice that was made known through the Law and the Prophets has now
    been revealed outside the Law, &nbsp;since it is the same justice of God
    that comes through faith to everyone, Jew and pagan alike, who believes in
    Jesus Christ. &nbsp;Both Jew and pagan sinned and forfeited God's glory,
    &nbsp;and both are justified through the free gift of his grace by being
    redeemed in Christ Jesus &nbsp;who was appointed by God to sacrifice his
    life so as to win reconciliation through faith. In this way God makes his
    justice known; first, for the past, when sins went unpunished because he
    held his hand,&nbsp;then, for the present age, by showing positively that he
    is just, and that he justifies everyone who believes in Jesus. &nbsp;So what
    becomes of our boasts? There is no room for them. What sort of law excludes
    them? The sort of law that tells us what to do? On the contrary, it is the
    law of faith, &nbsp;since, as we see it, a man is justified by faith and not
    by doing something the Law tells him to do. &nbsp;Is God the God of Jews
    alone and not of the pagans too? Of the pagans too, most certainly,
    &nbsp;since there is only one God.

    Jesus said: 'Alas for you who build the tombs of the prophets, the men your
    ancestors killed! &nbsp;In this way you both witness what your ancestors did
    and approve it; they did the killing, you do the building. &nbsp;'And that
    is why the Wisdom of God said, "I will send them prophets and apostles; some
    they will slaughter and persecute, &nbsp;so that this generation will have
    to answer for every prophet's blood that has been shed since the foundation
    of the world,&nbsp;from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was
    murdered between the altar and the sanctuary". Yes, I tell you, this
    generation will have to answer for it all. &nbsp;'Alas for you lawyers who
    have taken away the key of knowledge! You have not gone in yourselves, and
    have prevented others going in who wanted to.' &nbsp;When he left the house,
    the scribes and the Pharisees began a furious attack on him and tried to
    force answers from him on innumerable questions, &nbsp;setting traps to
    catch him out in something he might say.

    What shall we say about Abraham, the ancestor from whom we are all
    descended. &nbsp;If Abraham was justified as a reward for doing something,
    he would really have had something to boast about, though not in God's sight
    &nbsp;because scripture says: Abraham put his faith in God, and this faith
    was considered as justifying him. &nbsp;If a man has work to show, his wages
    are not considered as a favour but as his due; &nbsp;but when a man has
    nothing to show except faith in the one who justifies sinners, then his
    faith is considered as justifying him. &nbsp;And David says the same: a man
    is happy if God considers him righteous, irrespective of good deeds:
    &nbsp;Happy those whose crimes are forgiven, whose sins are blotted out;
    &nbsp;happy the man whom the Lord considers sinless.

    The people had gathered in their thousands so that they were treading on one
    another. And Jesus began to speak, first of all to his disciples. 'Be on
    your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees-that is, their hypocrisy.
    &nbsp;Everything that is now covered will be uncovered, and everything now
    hidden will be made clear. &nbsp;For this reason, whatever you have said in
    the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in
    hidden places will be proclaimed on the housetops. &nbsp;'To you my friends
    I say: Do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no

    has the power to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him. &nbsp;Can you

    The promise of inheriting the world was not made to Abraham and his
    descendants on account of any law but on account of the righteousness which
    consists in faith. &nbsp;That is why what fulfils the promise depends on
    faith, so that it may be a free gift and be available to all of Abraham's
    descendants, not only those who belong to the Law but also those who belong
    to the faith of Abraham who is the father of all of us. &nbsp;As scripture
    says: I have made you the ancestor of many nations. Abraham is our father in
    the eyes of God, in whom he put his faith, and who brings the dead to life
    and calls into being what does not exist. &nbsp;Though it seemed Abraham's

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'I tell you, if anyone openly declares himself
    for me in the presence of men, the Son of Man will declare himself for him
    in the presence of God's angels. &nbsp;But the man who disowns me in the
    presence of men will be disowned in the presence of God's angels.
    &nbsp;'Everyone who says a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but
    he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. &nbsp;'When
    they take you before synagogues and magistrates and authorities, do not
    worry about how to defend yourselves or what to say, &nbsp;because when the
    time comes, the Holy Spirit will teach you what you must say.'
