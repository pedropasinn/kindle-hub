    From Rephidim the Israelites set out again; and when they reached the
    wilderness of Sinai, there in the wilderness they pitched their camp; there
    facing the mountain Israel pitched camp. Moses then went up to God, and
    Yahweh called to him from the mountain, saying, 'Say this to the House of
    Jacob, declare this to the sons of Israel, "You yourselves have seen what I
    did with the Egyptians, how I carried you on eagle's wings and brought you
    to myself. From this you know that now, if you obey my voice and hold fast

    We were still helpless when at his appointed moment Christ died for sinful
    men. It is not easy to die even for a good man - though of course for
    someone really worthy, a man might be prepared to die - but what proves that
    God loves us is that Christ died for us while we were still sinners. Having
    died to make us righteous, is it likely that he would now fail to save us
    from God's anger? When we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, we
    were still enemies; now that we have been reconciled, surely we may count on
    being saved by the life of his Son? Not merely because we have been
    reconciled but because we are filled with joyful trust in God, through our
    Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have already gained our reconciliation.

    When Jesus saw the crowds he felt sorry for them because they were harassed
    and dejected, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples,
    'The harvest is rich but the labourers are few, so ask the Lord of the
    harvest to send labourers to his harvest'. He summoned his twelve disciples,
    and gave them authority over unclean spirits with power to cast them out and
    to cure all kinds of diseases and sickness. These are the names of the
    twelve apostles: first, Simon who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew;
    James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John; Philip and Bartholomew;
    Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and
    Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, the one who was to betray
    him. These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them as follows: 'Do not turn
    your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town; go
    rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel. And as you go, proclaim
    that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand. Cure the sick, raise the dead,
    cleanse the lepers, cast out devils. You received without charge, give
    without charge.

    Jesus said to the crowds: 'This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man
    throws seed on the land. Night and day, while he sleeps, when he is awake,
    the seed is sprouting and growing; how, he does not know. Of its own accord
    the land produces first the shoot, then the ear, then the full grain in the
    ear. And when the crop is ready, he loses no time: he starts to reap because
    the harvest has come.' He also said, 'What can we say the kingdom of God is
    like? What parable can we find for it? It is like a mustard seed which at
    the time of its sowing in the soil is the smallest of all the seeds on
    earth; yet once it is sown it grows into the biggest shrub of them all and
    puts out big branches so that the birds of the air can shelter in its
    shade.' Using many parables like these, he spoke the word to them, so far as
    they were capable of understanding it. He would not speak to them except in
    parables, but he explained everything to his disciples when they were alone.

    We acknowledge that what makes a man righteous is not obedience to the Law,

    less than you had, and now we hold that faith in Christ rather than fidelity
    to the Law is what justifies us, and that no one can be justified by keeping
    the Law. In other words, through the Law I am dead to the Law, so that now I
    can live for God. I have been crucified with Christ, and I live now not with
    my own life but with the life of Christ who lives in me. The life I now live
    in this body I live in faith: faith in the Son of God who loved me and who

    One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to a meal. When he arrived at the
    Pharisee's house and took his place at table, a woman came in, who had a bad
    name in the town. She had heard he was dining with the Pharisee and had
    brought with her an alabaster jar of ointment.7:38 She waited behind him at
    his feet, weeping, and her tears fell on his feet, and she wiped them away
    with her hair; then she covered his feet with kisses and anointed them with
    the ointment. When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to
    himself, 'If this man were a prophet, he would know who this woman is that
    is touching him and what a bad name she has'. Then Jesus took him up and
    said, 'Simon, I have something to say to you'. 'Speak, Master' was the
    reply. 'There was once a creditor who had two men in his debt; one owed him
    five hundred denarii, the other fifty. They were unable to pay, so he
    pardoned them both. Which of them will love him more?' 'The one who was
    pardoned more, I suppose' answered Simon. Jesus said, 'You are right'. Then
    he turned to the woman. 'Simon,' he said 'you see this woman? I came into
    your house, and you poured no water over my feet, but she has poured out her
    tears over my feet and wiped them away with her hair. You gave me no kiss,
    but she has been covering my feet with kisses ever since I came in. You did
    not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. For
    this reason I tell you that her sins, her many sins, must have been forgiven
    her, or she would not have shown such great love. It is the man who is
    forgiven little who shows little love.' Then he said to her, 'Your sins are
    forgiven'. Those who were with him at table began to say to themselves, 'Who
    is this man, that he even forgives sins?' But he said to the woman, 'Your
    faith has saved you; go in peace'. Now after this he made his way through
    towns and villages preaching, and proclaiming the Good News of the kingdom
    of God. With him went the Twelve, as well as certain women who had been
    cured of evil spirits and ailments: Mary surnamed the Magdalene, from whom
    seven demons had gone out, Joanna the wife of Herod's steward Chuza,

    As God's fellow workers, we beg you once again not to neglect the grace of
    God that you have received. For he says: At the favourable time, I have
    listened to you; on the day of salvation I came to your help. Well, now is
    the favourable time; this is the day of salvation. We do nothing that people
    might object to, so as not to bring discredit on our function as God's
    servants. Instead, we prove we are servants of God by great fortitude in
    times of suffering: in times of hardship and distress; when we are flogged,
    or sent to prison, or mobbed; labouring, sleepless, starving. We prove we
    are God's servants by our purity, knowledge, patience and kindness; by a
    spirit of holiness, by a love free from affectation; by the word of truth
    and by the power of God; by being armed with the weapons of righteousness in
    the right hand and in the left, prepared for honour or disgrace, for blame
    or praise; taken for impostors while we are genuine; obscure yet famous;
    said to be dying and here are we alive; rumoured to be executed before we
    are sentenced; thought most miserable and yet we are always rejoicing; taken

    Naboth of Jezreel had a vineyard close by the palace of Ahab king of
    Samaria, and Ahab said to Naboth, 'Give me your vineyard to be my vegetable
    garden, since it adjoins my house; I will give you a better vineyard for it
    or, if you prefer, I will give you its worth in money'. But Naboth answered
    Ahab, 'The Lord forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my
    ancestors!' Ahab went home gloomy and out of temper at the words of Naboth
    of Jezreel, 'I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers'. He lay down
    on his bed and turned his face away and refused to eat. His wife Jezebel
    came to him. 'Why are you so dispirited' she said 'that you will not eat?'
    He said, 'I have been speaking to Naboth of Jezreel; I said: Give me your
    vineyard either for money or, if you prefer, for another vineyard in
    exchange. But he said, "I will not give you my vineyard".' Then his wife
    Jezebel said, 'You make a fine king of Israel, and no mistake! Get up and
    eat; cheer up, and you will feel better; I will get you the vineyard of
    Naboth of Jezreel myself.' So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed
    them with his seal, sending them to the elders and nobles who lived where
    Naboth lived. In the letters she wrote, 'Proclaim a fast, and put Naboth in
    the forefront of the people. Confront him with a couple of scoundrels who
    will accuse him like this, "You have cursed God and the king" Then take him
    outside and stone him to death.' The men of Naboth's town, the elders and
    nobles who lived in his town, did what Jezebel ordered, what was written in
    the letters she had sent them. They proclaimed a fast and put Naboth in the
    forefront of the people. Then the two scoundrels came and stood in front of
    him and made their accusation, 'Naboth has cursed God and the king'. They
    led him outside the town and stoned him to death. They then sent word to
    Jezebel, 'Naboth has been stoned to death'. When Jezebel heard that Naboth
    had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, 'Get up! Take possession of the
    vineyard which Naboth of Jezreel would not give you for money, for Naboth is
    no longer alive, he is dead.' When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got
    up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel and take possession of
    it.

    Here, brothers, is the news of the grace of God which was given in the
    churches in Macedonia ; and of how, throughout great trials by suffering,
    their constant cheerfulness and their intense poverty have overflowed in a
    wealth of generosity. I can swear that they gave not only as much as they
    could afford, but far more, and quite spontaneously, begging and begging us
    for the favour of sharing in this service to the saints and, what was quite
    unexpected, they offered their own selves first to God and, under God, to
    us. Because of this, we have asked Titus, since he has already made a
    beginning, to bring this work of mercy to the same point of success among
    you. You always have the most of everything - of faith, of eloquence, of
    understanding, of keenness for any cause, and the biggest share of our
    affection - so we expect you to put the most into this work of mercy too. It
    is not an order that I am giving you; I am just testing the genuineness of
    your love against the keenness of others. Remember how generous the Lord
    Jesus was: he was rich, but he became poor for your sake, to make you rich
    out of his poverty.

    After the death of Naboth, the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite,
    'Up! Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, in Samaria. You will find him in
    Naboth's vineyard; he has gone down to take possession of it. You are to say
    this to him, "The Lord says this: You have committed murder; now you usurp
    as well. For this - and the Lord says this - in the place where the dogs
    licked the blood of Naboth, the dogs will lick your blood too."' Ahab said
    to Elijah, 'So you have found me out, O my enemy!' Elijah answered, 'I have
    found you out. For your double dealing, and since you have done what is
    displeasing to the Lord, I will now bring disaster down on you; I will sweep
    away your descendants, and wipe out every male belonging to the family of
    Ahab, fettered or free in Israel. I will treat your House as I treated the
    House of Jeroboam son of Nebat and of Baasha son of Ahijah, for provoking my
    anger and leading Israel into sin. (Against Jezebel too the Lord spoke these
    words: The dogs will eat Jezebel in the Field of Jezreel.) Those of Ahab's
    family who die in the city, the dogs will eat; and those who die in the open
    country, the birds of the air will eat.' And indeed there never was anyone
    like Ahab for double dealing and for doing what is displeasing to the Lord,
    urged on by Jezebel his wife. He behaved in the most abominable way,
    adhering to idols, just as the Amorites used to do whom the Lord had
    dispossessed for the sons of Israel. When Ahab heard these words, he tore
    his garments and put sackcloth next his skin and fasted; he slept in the
    sackcloth; he walked with slow steps. Then the word of the Lord came to
    Elijah the Tishbite, 'Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me?
    Since he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the disaster in his
    days; I will bring the disaster down on his House in the days of his son.'

    Do not forget: thin sowing means thin reaping; the more you sow, the more
    you reap. Each one should give what he has decided in his own mind, not
    grudgingly or because he is made to, for God loves a cheerful giver. And
    there is no limit to the blessings which God can send you - he will make
    sure that you will always have all you need for yourselves in every possible
    circumstance, and still have something to spare for all sorts of good works.
    As scripture says: He was free in almsgiving, and gave to the poor: his good
    deeds will never be forgotten. The one who provides seed for the sower and
    bread for food will provide you with all the seed you want and make the

    This is what happened when the Lord took Elijah up to heaven in the
    whirlwind: Elijah and Elisha set out from Gilgal.2:6 When he came to
    Jericho, Elijah said, 'Elisha, please stay here, the Lord is only sending me
    to the Jordan '. But he replied, 'As the Lord lives and as you yourself
    live, I will not leave you!' And they went on together. Fifty of the
    brotherhood of prophets followed them, halting some distance away as the two
    of them stood beside the Jordan. Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up and
    struck the water; and the water divided to left and right, and the two of
    them crossed over dry-shod. When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha,
    'Make your request. What can I do for you before I am taken from you?'
    Elisha answered, 'Let me inherit a double share of your spirit'. 'Your
    request is a difficult one' Elijah said. 'If you see me while I am being
    taken from you, it shall be as you ask; if not, it will not be so.' Now as
    they walked on, talking as they went, a chariot of fire appeared and horses
    of fire, coming between the two of them; and Elijah went up to heaven in the
    whirlwind. Elisha saw it, and shouted, 'My father! My father! Chariot of
    Israel and its chargers!' Then he lost sight of him, and taking hold of his
    clothes he tore them in half. He picked up the cloak of Elijah which had
    fallen, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. He took the cloak
    of Elijah and struck the water. 'Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah?' he
    cried. He struck the water, and it divided to right and left, and Elisha
    crossed over.

    from your Father in heaven. So when you give alms, do not have it trumpeted
    before you; this is what the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
    streets to win men's admiration. I tell you solemnly, they have had their
    reward. But when you give alms, your left hand must not know what your right
    is doing; your almsgiving must be secret, and your Father who sees all that
    is done in secret will reward you. 'And when you pray, do not imitate the
    hypocrites: they love to say their prayers standing up in the synagogues and
    at the street corners for people to see them; I tell you solemnly, they have
    had their reward. But when you pray, go to your private room and, when you
    have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in that secret place, and
    your Father who sees all that is done in secret will reward you. 'When you
    fast do not put on a gloomy look as the hypocrites do: they pull long faces
    to let men know they are fasting. I tell you solemnly, they have had their
    reward. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that
    no one will know you are fasting except your Father who sees all that is
    done in secret; and your Father who sees all that is done in secret will
    reward you.

    I only wish you were able to tolerate a little foolishness from me. But of
    course: you are tolerant towards me. You see, the jealousy that I feel for
    you is God's own jealousy: I arranged for you to marry Christ so that I
    might give you away as a chaste virgin to this one husband. But the serpent,
    with his cunning, seduced Eve, and I am afraid that in the same way your
    ideas may get corrupted and turned away from simple devotion to Christ.
    Because any new-comer has only to proclaim a new Jesus, different from the
    one that we preached, or you have only to receive a new spirit, different
    from the one you have already received, or a new gospel, different from the
    one you have already accepted - and you welcome it with open arms. As far as
    I can tell, these arch-apostles have nothing more than I have. I may not be
    a polished speechmaker, but as for knowledge, that is a different matter;
    surely we have made this plain, speaking on every subject in front of all of
    you. Or was I wrong, lowering myself so as to lift you high, by preaching
    the gospel of God to you and taking no fee for it? I was robbing other
    churches living on them so that I could serve you. When I was with you and
    ran out of money, I was no burden to anyone; the brothers who came from
    Macedonia provided me with everything I wanted. I was very careful, and I
    always shall be, not to be a burden to you in any way, and by Christ's truth
    in me, this cause of boasting will never be taken from me in the regions of
    Achaia. Would I do that if I did not love you? God knows I do.

    The prophet Elijah arose like a fire, his word flaring like a torch. It was
    he who brought famine on them, and who decimated them in his zeal. By the
    word of the Lord, he shut up the heavens, he also, three times, brought down
    fire. How glorious you were in your miracles, Elijah! Has anyone reason to
    boast as you have?- rousing a corpse from death, from Sheol by the word of
    the Most High; dragging kings down to destruction, and high dignitaries from
    their beds; hearing reproof on Sinai, and decrees of punishment on Horeb;
    anointing kings as avengers, and prophets to succeed you; taken up in the
    whirlwind of fire, in a chariot with fiery horses; designated in the
    prophecies of doom to allay God's wrath before the fury breaks, to turn the
    hearts of fathers towards their children, and to restore the tribes of
    Jacob, Happy shall they be who see you, and those who have fallen asleep in
    love; for we too will have life. Elijah was shrouded in the whirlwind, and
    Elisha was filled with his spirit; throughout his life no ruler could shake
    him, and no one could subdue him. No task was too hard for him, and even in
    death his body prophesied. In his lifetime he performed wonders, and in
    death his works were marvelous.

    Jesus said to his disciples: In your prayers do not babble as the pagans do,
    for they think that by using many words they will make themselves heard. Do
    not be like them; your Father knows what you need before you ask him. So you
    should pray like this: 'Our Father in heaven, may your name be held holy,
    your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as in heaven. Give us today
    our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we have forgiven those who are
    in debt to us. And do not put us to the test, but save us from the evil one.
    Yes, if you forgive others their failings, your heavenly Father will forgive
    you yours; but if you do not forgive others, your Father will not forgive
    your failings either.

    So many others have been boasting of their worldly achievements, that I will
    boast myself. But if anyone wants some brazen speaking - I am still talking
    as a fool - then I can be as brazen as any of them, and about the same
    things. Hebrews, are they? So am I. Israelites? So am I. Descendants of
    Abraham? So am I.11:23 The servants of Christ? I must be mad to say this,
    but so am I, and more than they: more, because I have worked harder, I have
    been sent to prison more often, and whipped many times more, often almost to
    death. Five times I had the thirty-nine lashes from the Jews; three times I
    have been beaten with sticks; once I was stoned; three times I have been
    shipwrecked and once adrift in the open sea for a night and a day.
    Constantly traveling, I have been in danger from rivers and in danger from
    brigands, in danger from my own people and in danger from pagans; in danger
    in the towns, in danger in the open country, danger at sea and danger from
    so-called brothers. I have worked and laboured, often without sleep; I have
    been hungry and thirsty and often starving; I have been in the cold without
    clothes. And, to leave out much more, there is my daily preoccupation: my
    anxiety for all the churches. When any man has had scruples, I have had
    scruples with him; when any man is made to fall, I am tortured. If I am to
    boast, then let me boast of my own feebleness.

    A reading from the second Book of Kings<span class="alindcha">11:1-4.9-18.20</span>
  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah learned that her son was dead, she
    promptly did away with all those of royal stock. But Jehosheba, daughter of
    King Jehoram and sister of Ahaziah, secretly took away Jehoash, her
    brother's son, from among the sons of the king who were being murdered, and
    put him with his nurse in the sleeping quarters; in this way she hid him
    from Athaliah, and he was not put to death. He stayed with her for six
    years, hidden in the Temple of the Lord, while Athaliah governed the
    country. In the seventh year, Jehoiada sent for the commanders of hundreds
    of the Carians and of the guards, and had them brought to him in the Temple
    of the Lord. He made a pact with them and, putting them under oath, showed
    them the king's son. The commanders of hundreds did everything as Jehoiada
    the priest had ordered. They brought their men, those coming off duty on the
    sabbath together with those mounting guard on the sabbath, and came to
    Jehoiada the priest. The priest equipped the commanders of hundreds with
    King David's spears and shields which were in the Temple of the Lord. The
    guards formed up, each man with his weapon in his hand, from the south
    corner to the north corner of the Temple, surrounding the altar and the
    Temple. Then Jehoiada brought out the king's son, put the crown and armlets
    on him, and he anointed him king. They clapped their hands and shouted,
    'Long live the king!' Athaliah, on hearing the shouts of the people, made
    for the Temple of the Lord where the people were. When she saw the king
    standing there beside the pillar, as the custom was, with the captains and
    trumpeters at the king's side, and all the country people rejoicing and
    sounding trumpets, Athaliah tore her garments and shouted, 'Treason,
    treason!' Then Jehoiada the priest gave the order to the army officers:
    'Take her outside the precincts and put to death anyone who follows her'.
    'For' the priest had reasoned 'she must not be put to death in the Temple of
    the Lord.' They seized her, and when she had reached the palace through the
    Entry of the Horses, she was put to death there. Jehoiada made a covenant
    between the Lord and king and people, by which the latter undertook to be
    the people of the Lord; and also between king and people. All the country
    people then went to the temple of Baal and demolished it; they smashed his
    altars and his images and killed Mattan, priest of Baal, in front of the
    altars. The priest posted sentries to guard the Temple of the Lord. All the
    country people were delighted, and the city made no move. And they put
    Athaliah to death in the royal palace.

    Must I go on boasting, though there is nothing to be gained by it? But I
    will move on to the visions and revelations I have had from the Lord. I know
    a man in Christ who, fourteen years ago, was caught up whether still in the
    body or out of the body, I do not know; God knows-right into the third
    heaven. I do know, however, that this same person-whether in the body or out
    of the body, I do not know; God knows- was caught up into paradise and heard
    things which must not and cannot be put into human language. I will boast
    about a man like that, but not about anything of my own except my
    weaknesses. If I should decide to boast, I should not be made to look
    foolish, because I should only be speaking the truth; but I am not going to,
    in case anyone should begin to think I am better than he can actually see
    and hear me to be. In view of the extraordinary nature of these revelations,
    to stop me from getting too proud I was given a thorn in the flesh, an angel
    of Satan to beat me and stop me from getting too proud! About this thing, I
    have pleaded with the Lord three times for it to leave me, but he has said,
    'My grace is enough for you: my power is at its best in weakness'. So I
    shall be very happy to make my weaknesses my special boast so that the power
    of Christ may stay over me, and that is why I am quite content with my
    weaknesses, and with insults, hardships, persecutions, and the agonies I go
    through for Christ's sake. For it is when I am weak that I am strong.

    A reading from the second Book of Chronicles<span class="alindcha">24:17-25</span>
  </p>
  <p class="Incipit-oneline">
    After the death of Jehoiada, the officials of Judah came to pay court to the
    king, and the king now turned to them for advice. The Judaeans abandoned the
    Temple of the Lord, the God of their ancestors, for the worship of sacred
    poles and idols. Because of their guilt, God's anger fell on Judah and
    Jerusalem. He sent them prophets to bring them back to the Lord, but when
    these gave their message, they would not listen. The spirit of God took
    possession of Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood up before the
    people and said, 'God says this, "Why do you transgress the commandments of
    the Lord to no good purpose? You have deserted the Lord, now he deserts
    you."' They then plotted against him and by order of the king stoned him in
    the court of the Temple of the Lord. King Joash, forgetful of the kindness
    that Jehoiada, the father of Zechariah, had shown him, killed Jehoiada's son
    who cried out as he died, 'The Lord sees and he will avenge!' When a year
    had gone by, the Aramaean army made war on Joash. They reached Judah and
    Jerusalem, and executed all the officials among the people, sending back to
    the king at Damascus all that they had plundered from them. Though the
    Aramaean army had by no means come in force, the Lord delivered into its
    power an army of great size for having deserted him, the God of their
    ancestors. The Aramaeans treated Joash as he had deserved, and when they
    retired they left him a very sick man; and his officers, plotting against
    him to avenge the death of the son of Jehoiada the priest, murdered him in
    his bed. So he died, and they buried him in the Citadel of David, though not
    in the tombs of the kings.

    Jesus said to his disciples: 'No one can be the slave of two masters: he
    will either hate the first and love the second, or treat the first with
    respect and the second with scorn. You cannot be the slave both of God and
    of money. 'That is why I am telling you not to worry about your life and
    what you are to eat, nor about your body and how you are to clothe it.
    Surely life means more than food, and the body more than clothing! Look at
    the birds in the sky. They do not sow or reap or gather into barns; yet your
    heavenly Father feeds them. Are we not worth much more than they are? Can
    any of you, for all his worrying, add one single cubit to his span of life?
    And why worry about clothing? Think of the flowers growing in the fields;
    they never have to work or spin; yet I assure you that not even Solomon in
    all his regalia was robed like one of these. Now if that is how God clothes
    the grass in the field which is there today and thrown into the furnace
    tomorrow, will he not much more look after you, you men of little faith? So
    do not worry; do not say, "What are we to eat? What are we to drink? How are
    we to be clothed?" It is the pagans who set their hearts on all these
    things. Your heavenly Father knows you need them all. Set your hearts on his
    kingdom first, and on his righteousness, and all these other things will be
    given you as well. So do not worry about tomorrow: tomorrow will take care
    of itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
