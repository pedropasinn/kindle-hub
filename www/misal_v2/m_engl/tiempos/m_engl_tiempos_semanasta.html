  <h2>Holy Week<br />Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion</h2>
</div>
<div class="engl hijo hijo_2" ontouchend="cambialengua(this)">
  <span class="red">On this day the Church recalls the entrance of Christ the Lord into
    Jerusalem to accomplish his Paschal Mystery. Accordingly, the memorial of
    this entrance of the Lord takes place at all Masses, by means of the
    Procession or the Solemn Entrance before the principal Mass or the Simple
    Entrance before other Masses. The Solemn Entrance, but not the Procession,
    may be repeated before other Masses that are usually celebrated with a large
    gathering of people.<br />It is desirable that, where neither the Procession
    nor the Solemn Entrance can take place, there be a sacred celebration of the
    Word of God on the messianic entrance and on the Passion of the Lord, either
    on Saturday evening or on Sunday at a convenient time.</span>

  Today we gather together to herald with the whole Church the beginning of the
  celebration<br />of our Lord's Paschal Mystery,<br />that is to say, of his
  Passion and Resurrection.<br />For it was to accomplish this mystery<br />that
  he entered his own city of Jerusalem.<br />Therefore, with all faith and
  devotion,<br />let us commemorate<br />the Lord's entry into the city for our
  salvation,<br />following in his footsteps,<br />so that, being made by his
  grace partakers of the Cross,<br />we may have a share also in his
  Resurrection and in his life.
