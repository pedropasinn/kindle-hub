  <h2>THURSDAY OF HOLY WEEK<br />[HOLY THURSDAY]</h2>
  <span class="red">1. In accordance with a most ancient tradition of the Church, on this day
    all Masses without the people are forbidden.</span>
  <h3>The Chrism Mass</h3>
  <span class="red">2. The blessing of the Oil of the Sick and of the Oil of Catechumens and
    the consecration of the Chrism are carried out by the Bishop, according to
    the Rite described in the Roman Pontifical, usually on this day, at a proper
    Mass to be celebrated during the morning.<br />3. If, however, it is very
    difficult for the clergy and the people to gather with the Bishop on this
    day, the Chrism Mass may be anticipated on another day, but near to
    Easter.<br />4. This Mass, which the Bishop concelebrates with his
    presbyterate, should be, as it were, a manifestation of the Priests'
    communion with their Bishop. Accordingly it is desirable that all the
    Priests participate in it, insofar as is possible, and during it receive
    Communion even under both kinds. To signify the unity of the presbyterate of
    the diocese, the Priests who concelebrate with the Bishop should be from
    different regions of the diocese.<br />5. In accord with traditional
    practice, the blessing of the Oil of the Sick takes place before the end of
    the Eucharistic Prayer, but the blessing of the Oil of Catechumens and the
    consecration of the Chrism take place after Communion. Nevertheless, for
    pastoral reasons, it is permitted for the entire rite of blessing to take
    place after the Liturgy of the Word.</span>

  <span class="red">8. After the reading of the Gospel, the Bishop preaches the Homily in
    which, taking his starting point from the text of the readings proclaimed in
    the Liturgy of the Word, he speaks to the people and to his Priests about
    priestly anointing, urging the Priests to be faithful in their office and
    calling on them to renew publicly their priestly promises.</span>

  <h4>Preface</h4>
  <span class="red">The Priesthood of Christ and the Ministry of Priests.
  </span>
  <p>
    It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and
    everywhere to give you thanks,<br />Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal
    God.
  </p>
  <p>
    For by the anointing of the Holy Spirit<br />you made your Only Begotten
    Son<br />High Priest of the new and eternal covenant,<br />and by your
    wondrous design were pleased to decree<br />that his one Priesthood should
    continue in the Church.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Christ not only adorns with a royal priesthood the people he has made
    his own,<br />but with a brother's kindness he also chooses men<br />to
    become sharers in his sacred ministry<br />through the laying on of hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    They are to renew in his name<br />the sacrifice of human redemption,<br />to
    set before your children the paschal banquet,<br />to lead your holy people
    in charity,<br />to nourish them with the word<br />and strengthen them with
    the Sacraments.
  </p>
  <p>
    As they give up their lives for you<br />and for the salvation of their
    brothers and sisters,<br />they strive to be conformed to the image of
    Christ himself<br />and offer you a constant witness of faith and love.
  </p>
  <p>
    And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,<br />we, too, give you thanks
    as in exultation we acclaim:
  </p>
