        In your infinit goodness<br />you have given to the virgin Church<br />the

        She is the Virgin of prayer,<br />who sings of your mercy in her

        of Cana<br />and intercedes for them with her Son,<br />who prays with
        the apostles in oneness of mind and heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        She is the Virgin Mother,<br />who gives birth to your Son by the power
        of the Holy Spirit<br />and at the foot of the Cross is proclaimed as
        mother<br />of the people of the New Covenant.
      </p>
      <p>
        She is the Virgin who offers,<br />presenting the Firstborn in your
        temple<br />and sharing in his self-offering<br />beside the tree of
        everlasting life.
      </p>
      <p>
        She is the Virgin who keeps vigil,<br />awaiting the resurrection of her
        Son<br />with unwavering hope<br />and looking forward to the coming of
        the Holy Spirit<br />with steadfast faith.
